# 3-financial-decisions-that-affect-how-much-wealth-youll-have
I’ve made **3 financial decisions** in my life that have literally **added hundreds of thousands of dollars** to my net worth.

When you get these decisions wrong, they can do a lot of damage to your financial future.

What do all three decisions have in common?

They’re all tied to the primary principle that I teach in my *Foundation to Financial Freedom* course:

**Build assets first, then spend. 📊**

Before I dive into the three decisions, let me ask you this:

When it comes to your personal finances, **what’s an asset**?

🏡 Is your house an asset?

🚗 What about your car?

I’ll answer these questions below, but before we dive in, remember my motto: **No Shame, No Blame, No Judgment**.

Put on your researcher’s hat as you read about my choices. I’m sharing them to help you identify areas where you can save some major dollars.

Don’t use my examples to beat yourself up if you feel you might have made different choices in the past.

Let’s leave the past behind and empower ourselves for a wealthier future.

On to those 3 decisions.

​

## Wealth-building Decision #1:

## We bought the least expensive house that met our minimum needs.

{Think of this as a kind of Minimum Viable Product for housing.}

We bought houses that were **well below what we could afford**, which meant that our monthly cash flow was not affected by the purchases.

I’ve been married to my Mr. YFL for 22 years now. In that time we’ve bought 2 houses.

The first house was modest with a lot of ugly features – including an unfinished, postage-stamp-sized yard – but it was in a great neighborhood with a lot of upside potential.

We stayed in that house for 9 years and made superficial improvements (nothing expensive).

Then we moved to bigger house in a nicer neighborhood in the burbs – **without spending a dime of extra money**.

We’d made enough improvements in the first house – without taking on any debt – to crank up its value, and we used that value to buy the second house outright.

We could have bought a more expensive house with each purchase, but we chose to get **just enough house** to meet our minimum requirements…

… while allowing us to keep:

✅ maxing out our **tax-advantaged** investment accounts;

✅ **investing** more money inside our businesses;

✅ enjoying nice trips with our girls.

## The problem with houses:

Everybody talks about houses being an asset.

**On paper, a house looks like an asset because you have equity** (i.e. what you’re left with once you sell the thing and pay off all the debts tied to the house), **but in reality it behaves like a liability.**

Probably the best definition I’ve ever heard for the word “asset” is this:

**An asset is something that puts money into your accounts.**

❓ When was the last time your house put more money into your checking account than it cost you?

It doesn’t until you sell the thing.

Even then, most people overestimate their profit by underestimating the true costs of:

- the mortgage interest,
- repairs,
- renovations,
- and ALL the things they bought to go into that house.

The entire time you live in your house, it costs you money on a monthly basis.

{**Sobering strategy**: When you talk about how much you paid for your house, don’t talk about the purchase price; talk about the purchase price + all the accrued interest payments to date. That’s how much you’ve paid for the house – so far, not including all the other costs I mentioned above.}

My husband and I chose to minimize the impact of that liability by buying a lot less house than we could afford.

As a result, **we had more than $100,000 of freed-up money to invest for our future**, which has compounded significantly over two decades. ✨

​

| ### The take-away:  🔸 When you buy a house, don’t be swayed by the lender or the mortgage agent when they tell you, “You can afford to buy a house of X dollars.” That amount is how much the lender will finance. The lender is concerned with its own risk assessment. It doesn’t know about your values or the fact that you want to max out your RRSPs. They’re simply looking at your debt-to-income ratios and some of the house-related costs.  Buying a house at that price may not be in your best interests. If you max out what the lender will finance, you may be giving up a fortune of future wealth.  **Consider buying the least amount of house you need, and use the balance to build wealth.**  ⚠️ Most of the clients I worked with during my Financial Repair Specialist days **got into financial hot water because they couldn’t afford their house and their lifestyle.**  In order to be cash flow positive, they had to be house poor.  Any way you slice it, that’s not a winning formula. All those people could barely afford to stay in their home, let alone invest money for their future. That’s not the path to financial security. |

## Wealth-building Decision #2:

## We chose to be a one-car family and drive boring, reliable vehicles.

When Mr. YFL and I got together, we each had a car and we held onto our individual cars until we had our first daughter.

At that point, we figured that having a child will add to our expenses. If we wanted to keep up our level of investments and start up an RESP on top of that, we’d be better off ditching the several thousand dollars of annual expenses associated with one of our cars and become a one-car family.

On the occasions where we needed access to two vehicles, we would use a taxi (Uber wasn’t an option back then.) Spending money on a few taxi rides a year was far cheaper than maintaining a second car.

It seemed counterintuitive to our friends.

Don’t most people buy another car – or a bigger one – when they have kids?

But we were working from a “Build assets first” model, which meant **minimizing unnecessary expenses that added no real value** on the one hand, to preserve our ability to keep investing.

Our girls are now 20 and 17, and we are still a one-car family.

And the cars aren’t sexy. Our first car was a Hyundai Elantra Touring, which lasted ten years before we sold it.

Our current car is a Rav4 Hybrid. We plan to hold onto it for ten years as well.

All those years ago I did some rough, back-of-the-envelope math to calculate how much we would save by only having one car. ✍️

It’s in the tens of thousands of dollars by now.

**Again, the savings have gone into investments to build our nest egg. 📈**

| ### The take-away:  🔸 A car is a liability, not an asset.  It does nothing but leach money out of your account through:  - insurance; - maintenance; - repairs; - and gas costs – assuming it’s not an electric vehicle.  If you love cars and you want an expensive one, or you want to own multiple vehicles, that’s cool.  But understand the Opportunity Cost when it comes to building wealth. |

## Wealth-building Decision #3:

## I learned to invest.

When I was with my first husband, I deferred all investing to him because I assumed he’d do a better job of it.

Which is kinda crazy because at that time, he didn’t know more than I did. 🤦🏻‍♀️

What he had, though, was confidence.

I made the mistake of **conflating confidence with** ***competence***.

That mistake cost me nearly $50,000, something I only discovered after his death.

When I remarried, I was determined to figure out investing, especially when I read the stats about the fact that **women, on average, have half the wealth that men have. 😠**

And that makes us vulnerable.

I’d already experienced financial trauma – to the tune of $400,000 of inherited debt after my first husband died.

I swore that I would never again be financially vulnerable.

So I hunkered down and spent the next five years learning an evidence-based system for investing.

{My research background came in handy. 🤓}

Honestly, **this has been the single most important thing I’ve done.**

Because it allowed me to put all our extra cash straight to work, compounding over the long term. 📈

Twenty dollars here, a few hundred there, and the occasional chunks of thousands as we saved money on housing and car expenses.

**Those small sums started to grow…**

**… and they became the multi-seven-figure portfolio we have today.**

### Here’s the thing:

💡 It’s not enough to save money; you also have to put it to work for you by investing it.

One of the most powerful things you can do for yourself, outside of locking in BIG WINS like👆 is **learn how to become a confident investor**.

Then funnel as much money as you can into your investments to build wealth.

When you’re wealthy, you can have the fanciest car around or the high end home of your dreams.

But I’m guessing that by the time you get there – having wealth that sets you free to do, be, and have whatever you like – you probably won’t care about the fancy car and the big house.

You’ll be too busy enjoying all the things that matter most to you and spending your money on your values.

That’s what taking a Build Wealth First approach does for you.

| ## Ideas for your finances  ​  ### ✨ Do a House Expense Audit.  Is there a way you can score some big wins on the housing front?  - Renegotiate your mortgage. - Negotiate a better rate for house insurance. - Consider moving if your household expenses chew up so much of your cash that you don’t have money left to invest.  Housing costs typically chew up the most significant amount of a person’s income.  It’s worth your time to see what you can renegotiate for a win.  One of my course students ended up saving more than $8,000 *per year* after doing a housing cost audit and making some calls.  If your house is leaving you feeling house poor, set up a [Discovery Call](https://preview.convertkit-mail2.com/click/dpheh0hzhm/aHR0cHM6Ly9jYWxlbmRseS5jb20veWZsL2Rpc2NvdmVyeWNhbGw=) and let’s chat. There’s always a way to find a better solution for you.  Lean on my 10 years as a Financial Repair Specialist to help you find a good outcome.  ​  ### ✨ Do the same for your transportation costs.  Are there other options that could help you score some wins and keep more dollars in your account for investing?  I get that some people need two vehicles because of work and family demands.  I’m not saying that you should necessarily be a one-car family.  What I’m saying is that transportation costs eat up a substantial portion of your take-home pay. It pays to take some time to assess your situation and optimize where you can.  ​  ### ✨ Feel the fear and learn to invest anyway!  I understand the fear and concerns about investing. You work hard for your money. The last thing you want to do is “gamble” with it.  That was me twenty years ago.  But in this case, **knowledge is power – and wealth.**  When you take an evidence-based approach, it’s not gambling, it’s proven wealth-building over time.  Take the first small step. Start by shifting your mindset and saying to yourself, “This year, I choose to learn to invest.”  Success starts in your mind.  It seems like a small step, but really, it’s huge.  As Wayne Dyer said, “When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.  And so it is with investing. |
