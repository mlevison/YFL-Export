If you could turn back the clock and talk to your 16-year-old self, what would you tell her or him about money?

**What choices did you make as a late teen or adult that you regret?**  
  
**What do you wish you had known about how money works and how to use it?**  
  
**What difference would it have made in your life** if you had known all the good stuff about personal finance as you entered adulthood?

## Staggering

The difference financial literacy makes can be staggering. I don‚Äôt say this lightly.  
  
I know this personally ‚Äì if you don‚Äôt know my story, [check it out](https://yourfinanciallaunchpad.com/about/) ‚Äì and I know this from my work with clients over the past fifteen years.  
  
Next week, I‚Äôll tell you about my second clients, Andrew & Patty, and the consequences they faced because of actions taken in their early 20‚Äôs. It took them years to pull themselves out of that hole.  
  
For now, **I want to focus on your child. My goal is to teach her or him everything I‚Äôve taught my seventeen-year-old about becoming financially secure as she prepares to head to university.**

### Introducing the Money-Smart Students Program

After receiving repeated questions about what I‚Äôm teaching my girls and what should kids know about money as they enter adulthood, I decided to teach a financial literacy course catered specifically ‚Äì and exclusively ‚Äì to 16-to-20-year-olds.  
  
I have put together a curriculum based on my *Take Charge of Your Money* course for adults. I adapted the material to be age-appropriate for high school and early post-secondary students.  
  
All of the details about the content I‚Äôll cover and the registration link can be found here:  
The [***Money-Smart Students Program***](https://yourfinanciallaunchpad.com/shop/money-smart-students-program/)***.***  
  

### Here is a quick overview:

‚û°Ô∏è I will teach **two groups live online** via Zoom.

‚û°Ô∏è Each group will get 6 hours of instruction over two consecutive afternoons.

‚û°Ô∏è Two months later, I will offer each group a **Financial Tune Up** (live online Q&A session) to answer their questions, help them deal with challenges, and ensure they‚Äôre on track.

‚û°Ô∏è **Group #1 is for Girls-Only.** It will take place from 1 pm ‚Äì 4 pm (Eastern Time) on August 18th and 19th. The Financial Tune Up for this group will take place on Saturday, October 16th starting at 2 pm Eastern Time.

**‚û°Ô∏è Group #2 is Co-Ed ‚Äì open to all 16-to-20-year-olds**. It will take place from 1 pm ‚Äì 4 pm (Eastern Time) on August 23rd and 24th. The Financial Tune Up for this group will take place on Saturday, October 23rd starting at 2 pm Eastern Time.

‚û°Ô∏è **Beta pricing is offered for this year only: $147 per person.** My intention is to launch the 1.0 recorded version in 2022 for $300. **This is the ONLY time this course will be offered at this beta price.**

‚û°Ô∏è Registration closes August 15th, 2021.

**This is the first time I offer this level of training for students and I can promise that it will be a game-changer for them.**

If you know of a student who would benefit from this, please forward this info to their parents.

I will not be offering this again in 2021 and I don‚Äôt currently have dates in 2022. This is the only offering for the foreseeable future. Grab a spot for your child and let‚Äôs make them financially savvy asap!
