#### If your finances were to deliver a February 1st Update, what would they say?

Would they claim one of the following?

- - You made the $250 payment on your Mastercard balance that you‚Äôd intended to make.
	- You created a **Conscious Spending Plan** and you‚Äôre sticking to it.
	- You **automated** $40 to your Planned Spending account every month.
	- You created a weekly **Money Ritual** to review your finances.
	- You redirected a portion of the dollars you normally spend on meals out to your TFSA.

**Or would your finances tell a different, less satisfying story?**

It turns out that answering this question, *this month*, will make a big difference to your results in December.

Here‚Äôs why.

## January gets all the attention

Nobody ever talks about February for their finances beyond talking about RRSPs (in Canada anyway).

It‚Äôs like the forgotten middle child of the calendar.

January is the media darling, isn‚Äôt it?

It gets all the hype around the new year and the promise of a **fresh start**.

Sure, no one looks forward to the sun setting before you have your afternoon coffee, and a thermostat in freefall. ü•∂

And yet, there‚Äôs so much to look forward to.

Your financial goals get a **refresh** and a polish, or a **complete overhaul**. You swear things are going to be different this year. üéØ

Off you go into the month with new goals and fresh resolve.

The good news, you think to yourself, is that you have a heap of time to get it all done.

## One month down

Then just like that, January is gone.

**Here‚Äôs the sexy thing about February**: It provides you with a **golden** **opportunity. üåü**

That opportunity is one that few people take advantage of, which can **cost them a fortune** in frustration and missed opportunities.

The golden opportunity is your chance to hit the **pause button** and review the results of the first thirty-one days of the year.

In just a sec, I‚Äôll share the **simple questions** to ask yourself in February to make sure you‚Äôre on track to hit your money goals this year.

First, a quick story about why **the most important part of February is NOT the fact that the RRSP deadline is coming up** at the end of the month.

## Maci‚Äôs story

Years ago, Maci\* took the earlier version of my money management course, then called *Take Charge of Your Money*. She hopped into the coached version to get help with significant financial challenges, which included ‚Ä¶

- $100,000 of credit card debt
- a practice of ‚Äúrobbing Peter to pay Paul‚Äù
- no real systems in place to deal with the many moving parts

She started the course in early January. After diving into the first module, she set a number of goals for the year and she created a checklist for January.

So far, so good.

When February 1st rolled around, I sent an email out to all my clients, recommending that they pause their tasks and take some time to review their progress in January.

Maci decided to put off the review. She felt that it was more important to look into her investments and get her RRSP contribution in before the deadline. Surely that was more important.

Normally, I‚Äôm a big fan of contributing to tax-sheltered accounts and growing your investments, but first you need to know if contributing to your RRSPs is the highest, best use of your money at that time.

It doesn‚Äôt *always* make sense.

## A Money Map

The problem for Maci is that she didn‚Äôt know where she stood financially. She hadn‚Äôt completed her Money Map ‚Äì a concept I teach in the course.

It‚Äôs a **visual representation** of her financial situation. Think of it as a combination of Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Statement for your personal finances, except in a visual format.

Creating her Money Map was at the top of her January to-do list. That task didn‚Äôt get done because Maci got distracted by other, less important tasks.

We didn‚Äôt discover this until the end of February when Maci resurfaced. By then she had used most of her extra dollars to make an RRSP contribution after ‚Äì *and this is important* ‚Äì **succumbing to an RRSP ad** by a bank.

The ad made her feel that if she didn‚Äôt make a contribution this year, she‚Äôd be missing out on all sorts of great outcomes.

**FOMO is a powerful behavioral bias. It makes you do crazy things** and the banks know it.

Pay attention to the emails from banks that slide into your inbox and ads that land in your social feeds this month. The banks will milk this bias for all it‚Äôs worth to get you to give them your dollars to funnel into *their* products.

When Maci‚Äôs car broke down a short while later, she didn‚Äôt have the funds to pay for the repair. Out came the Visa and up went her credit card debt.

It could all have been prevented by doing a Financial Review at the beginning of February.

## 7 Questions to ask yourself in February

It‚Äôs a mighty claim that February is the most important month for your finances, but I stand behind it.

In January, you create a financial path to follow for the year in the form of goals and subtasks.

By February, if you don‚Äôt take the time to check in with yourself, you could already be **several degrees off course**. The further you veer off track, the harder it is to correct.

Without this early review, you may well end up saying, ‚ÄúThis year will be different‚Äù for the umpteenth year in a row when January 1st rolls around.

You don‚Äôt want that.

Here are the questions to keep you on track:

#### 1\. What are my goals for the year?

I know, you‚Äôre only one month in, but it‚Äôs worth reminding yourself of what you said you wanted from the year. There‚Äôs no such thing as looking at your goals too often.

Look at them so often you feel they‚Äôre imprinted on your eyeballs.

#### 2\. What did I say I was going to do in January?

Which steps did you say you were going to complete last month?

If you hadn‚Äôt broken down your goals for the year into bite-sized chunks, that‚Äôs part of the problem. You won‚Äôt know until you answer this question.

If you said you were going to save money, how much money? Be specific.

#### 3\. What did I do or complete?

Look for the wins. Any action step you took toward your goals is worth celebrating.

We don‚Äôt celebrate our progress often enough, so take a moment to note down all the micro steps and give yourself a high five in the mirror, [Mel Robbins style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khujbeJvqcE).

Again, be specific. If you paid off debt, write down exactly how much you paid off.

If you put money in your Emergency Fund, list the dollar amount.

‚ÄúSome‚Äù isn‚Äôt a unit of measure.

#### 4\. What didn‚Äôt happen or didn‚Äôt get started, and why?

It‚Äôs important to not only identify what went wrong, but also figure out the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù beneath it.

Is it a matter of avoidance? Is fear holding you back?

Or did something happen that you couldn‚Äôt control and as a result, you didn‚Äôt get as much done as you‚Äôd planned?

Get granular here. The goal is to gain understanding, not shame and blame yourself. Remember my motto: **No Shame, No Blame, No Judgment.**

If you don‚Äôt identify the problem, you can‚Äôt fix it.

#### 5\. What needs to change in February?

**If you keep doing the same thing, you‚Äôll get the same results. Something needs to change in order to get better results.**

This is your opportunity to identify what that is for you.

Once you know what didn‚Äôt work, from Question 4, you can determine what would work instead. That‚Äôs the change you need to implement in February.

#### 6\. What is my first small action step?

Focus on a small step here. Small is doable and powerful. Get it done asap.

#### 7\. Is this step in line with my goals for the year?

Sometimes we get distracted into taking action that feels good, but won‚Äôt move the financial needle.

Selling your used ski equipment might feel good and it certainly would put a few extra dollars in your pocket, but is that the highest, best use of your time right now? Probably not.

Focus on the priorities for the year first.

## Last but not least

Set an **electronic reminder** in your calendar to do this all over again the first week of every remaining month in the year.

The process of **reviewing, reflecting and reconsidering** is so important to your success that it needs to be repeated at regular intervals.

Do yourself a big favor and set a calendar date with yourself at the start of every month.

If you‚Äôre part of my course community when I launch *Your Foundation to Financial Freedom*, you‚Äôll have me as your wing-man reminding you to do it.
