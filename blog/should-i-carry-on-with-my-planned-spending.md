#### Are you wondering where, or whether, to spend your dollars given the economic uncertainty at the moment?

I hear you. I’m getting that question a lot these days.

Last night, I opened up the doors to my **[Women’s Money Group](https://yflmainprod.wpengine.com/womens-money-group/)** Office Hours to non-members and one of the questions a guest asked had to do with this very topic.

One woman has been saving money for two large purchases and she wondered if it makes sense to go through with the spending or not?

Here’s what I said:

**Spend your money on things that will give you an immediate return on investment financially – as in, will help you make money within the next 90 days or will help you move the needle forward in your finances in some other way.**

### Defer, reduce, renegotiate or eliminate all other spending

For my guest, that means holding off on the big purchases, neither of which will provide her with a financial benefit.

Why? Because we have no idea how long it will take to get through the impact of Covid-19.

It could be many months before the world regains a sense of normalcy.

This isn’t panicking; it’s being prudent.

At the moment, I would prioritize building up your financial foundation if you’re in a position to do so.

If you have a stable income, double down on your **[Emergency Fund.](https://yflmainprod.wpengine.com/2018/07/rethinking-emergency-funds/)** Some writers in the personal finance space recommend a three-month buffer, however Covid-19 is showing us that that may not be sufficient.

Personally, I find it more prudent to target a buffer of six months to a year.

In other words, have access to enough cash that you could pay your essential expenses without a dime of income coming in. Ideally, it won’t come to that, but you’ll have resources set aside just in case it does.

When we’re past the threat of Covid-19 and a sense of normalcy is reestablished, then you can press ‘Play’ on your planned spending and carry on without any concerns.

## Insider access

In a couple of days, I’ll reach out again with ideas for those of you who have little to no income coming in. I’ve been working with a number of women in this situation. There are definitely strategies to survive and cope. More on this soon.
