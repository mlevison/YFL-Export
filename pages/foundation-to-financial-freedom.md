## Welcome to the Foundation to Financial Freedom Course!

## A Program to Help You Take Control of Your Finances,Strengthen Your Relationship with Money, and Grow Your Wealth

## Get More Joy and Peace of Mind from Your Dollars Without Nickle-and-Diming Yourself in a Restrictive Budget

##### When you use a proven system based on your core values‚Ä¶

##### ‚Ä¶ and you develop an empowering money mindset, saving money and achieving financial independence become doable.

##### In 9 weeks, you can transform your finances with this evidence-based, step-by-step system that is fully customized to your needs, values, and goals.

## If you're here, I know this much about you: You want your finances to be better and easier.

When you entered adulthood, you were told to get an education, get a good job, follow a budget and you‚Äôd be in great financial shape.

**What happened to the ‚Äúgreat financial shape‚Äù part?**

Your finances aren‚Äôt as *easy*, or as¬†*secure,* as you thought they would be by now.

Some days you think, ‚ÄúAt my age, I should be father ahead. Why am I not?‚Äù

#### It‚Äôs not for a lack of trying.

Maybe you did the whole budgeting thing to get a handle on your spending.

You downloaded Mint, tracked expenses, created categories and imposed spending limits.

Three months in, the whole ‚Äúmicro-managing‚Äù and ‚Äúobsessing-over-nickels‚Äù approach caused you so much stress and shame when you couldn‚Äôt stick to your spending targets that you said, ‚Äú!@\*?#ü§¨‚Äù while deleting the app.

Or maybe you‚Äôre the kind of super organized person who started budgeting when you were fifteen after getting your first job.

You know where every dime goes and you can list your budget off the top of your head.

Despite all that controlling and being careful, you‚Äôre still *nowhere near* your financial goals.

You think, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôm doing the work. When do I get to enjoy the fruits of my sacrifices?‚Äù

## The frustrating reality is this:

## Tracking your money is NOT the same as managing your money. And until you make the switch, you won't create the life you want.

## The problem isn't you

- You went to school for years. In that time, you learned:
- Calculus, grammar, the historical events behind D-Day, the parts of a cell, and the skills to do your work.
- But you were never really taught how to make, manage and grow your money.
- Your parents didn't teach you about money either - for a million understandable reasons that typically revolve around fear, discomfort, and shame.
- For most people, money is still a taboo subject.
- Your parents would rather talk to you about sex than money - and we all know how *that* talk turned out.

## You need a better approach for your finances

One that serves your unique situation, values and dreams.

One that‚Äôs doable by someone juggling 14 balls (that would be you).

And one that works *right now ‚Äì* without making money management feel like a punishment!

You don‚Äôt want to wait another ten years ‚Äì or more ‚Äì to be able to *finally* let your shoulders relax and enjoy life,  
without having to think about money ALL the time.

#### This is your chance to do just that without the restrictive, one-size-fits-all approach of traditional budgeting.

**A comprehensive, step-by-step course to help you take charge of your finances, strengthen your relationship with money, build your confidence, grow your savings account, and create great options for your future.**

You‚Äôll learn how to eliminate debt, build a financial safety net, and make more money so you can experience the peace of mind and the joy that come from knowing your future is secure.

## Before we get into all the course details,let's make sure you're a good fit. If you are...

- **A salaried professional** ...  
	who earns well but can't seem to save money consistently despite repeated attempts. You want that feeling of having a growing savings account, but you don't know how to make it happen.
- **A single mom** ...  
	who feels the weight of being the Plan A *and* the Plan B for the kids because there is no other backup. It's so hard to juggle everything on your own and right now, your finances are an additional stressor. You want to know how to create a safety net that will protect you while providing enough money to help your family enjoy some of the good things in life.
- **A solopreneur** ...  
	who is so busy trying to bring money in the door that you don't have time to figure out how to make all the moving parts of your finances work together. You want to know how to manage your money when you can't predict your month-to-month income. It's overwhelming.
- **Newly divorced** ...  
	and you're having to deal with your finances alone - ALL of it - for the first time. You desperately want to feel in control and confident, but right now you're overwhelmed and uncertain about what to do first.
- **Someone who has debt** ...  
	and you're worried about the future. You've tried to pay it off, but somehow it just always pops back up again. You wonder if being debt-free is even possible for you.

Choose from one of our two coaching packages.

## Premium Package

With the Premium Package, you have access to live, **bi-weekly coaching sessions for a full year**.

Think of this as Drop-In Office Hours. Attend as many sessions (or as few) as you like.

If you aren‚Äôt available for a scheduled session but you have a question, I‚Äôve got you covered. All the sessions are recorded.

When a financial question pops up over the next year, you simply reach out to me during the group coaching sessions and say:

‚ÄúHey Doris, what‚Äôs the best way to handle this? What are my options and how do I choose?‚Äù

Or:

‚ÄúDoris, I‚Äôm stuck. I just can‚Äôt seem to get moving. Can you help me through this?‚Äù

You can transform your finances much more quickly when you have someone in your corner, in real time, who‚Äôs been there, gotten the results, and coached thousands of other women to do the same.

Over the next year, we‚Äôll work closely together to help you overcome any money challenges you face and get on track with your financial goals.

This is also a great option if you want to take your finances to the next level.

We can move as quickly or as slowly as you need in this **Done *With* You** package.

I will hold your hand every step of the way for an entire year.

## But the best part about the CoachingPackages is the community.

Just imagine what it would feel like to tackle your finances *within a community of support‚Ä¶*

‚Ä¶ a group of women who *get* you because they‚Äôre doing the same kind of work on *their* finances.

Women who will cheer you on, support you through the hard times, and provide a safe space for you to talk about any part of your finances you like without shame, blame, or judgment.

It‚Äôs powerful!

##### Our community of women will keep you coming back every two weeks for twelve months to share, laugh, learn, and encourage each other.

## Meet Your Guide

#### Hi, I‚Äôm Doris!

I‚Äôm a financial literacy educator who has helped thousands of women take control of their money and create great options for themselves.

In my early thirties, I was widowed and left with $400,000 of debt, which I paid off in two years. I‚Äôve since built a multi-seven-figure net worth and a thriving business ‚Äì using my skills as a trained researcher and an evidence-based approach.

Here‚Äôs what I know to be true:

It doesn‚Äôt matter who you are, what you know, or what your current situation is. Financial freedom is possible with the right system, ongoing support, and a safe, no shame, no blame, no judgment environment in which to learn.

#### This is that safe space for you.

In this course, I created the system and the plan that I wish I‚Äôd had years ago when I stared down a mountain of debt.

At the time, it felt like I had few options for my future.

This course would have changed my life.

I created it so that *you* can achieve financial security, peace of mind, and freedom in a tiny fraction of the time it took me to figure it out and make it happen.

Life is short. Don‚Äôt waste another minute settling for less than you want. You can do this.

**Hop into the course and let‚Äôs get you to financial freedom as soon as possible!**

## Why women only?

**Because the reality is that the financial conversation changes when men are present.**

I know this from my experience running women-only courses and co-ed courses.

I also know this from my experience running a Women‚Äôs Money Group.

Women who were otherwise vocal and expressive in a women-only setting clammed up when men were in the room. It didn‚Äôt even take a male stranger to make them feel less comfortable speaking about money. The men in question were their partners, sons, nephews, and friends!

That‚Äôs why I design my courses with women in mind and I offer my **coaching packages for women only**.

#### In my coaching community, you‚Äôll get a safe space to talk about money

#### and my signature No Shame, No Blame, No Judgment approach.

## You'll be backed by my 30-Day Satisfaction Guaranteed or Your Money Back Guarantee

**If you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúThis sounds great, but I‚Äôm still not 100% sure it‚Äôs for me‚Äù you can try the course risk-free with my 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee.**

The best part is that it‚Äôs a No Hoops to Jump Through guarantee:

Either you like it and you keep going, or you don‚Äôt and you get a full refund.

It‚Äôs that simple.

I know what it‚Äôs like to be interested in taking a course, but you wonder, ‚ÄúWill this meet my expectations? What if I don‚Äôt like it?‚Äù

I *know* that my students get great results when they do the lessons and implement what they‚Äôve learned, but I get that you don‚Äôt know that yet.

I want you to feel confident about taking this step and to be fully satisfied with your purchase.

So if you‚Äôre on the fence, or if other trainings have left you disappointed‚Ä¶

Then **I want to give you the opportunity to dive into the material and experience the feeling of empowerment and excitement** that comes taking control of your money ‚Äì *risk-free*.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm offering a **30-Day** **Money Back Guarantee:**

Check out the video lessons and the tools that I provide. If you don‚Äôt find the course useful by the end of 30 days, send me an email and I will happily refund your full payment within 30 Days of the course start date. No hard feelings!

I‚Äôm SO confident that if you implement what you learn inside *Foundation to Financial Freedom (FTF)*, you‚Äôll transform your money and your life.

**You have nothing to lose and a bright, secure future to gain.**

## You deserve to have a life you love without financial stress and overwhelm.

You also deserve a money management system that serves you, and not the other way around.

It doesn‚Äôt have to be hard and painful.

I say this as someone whose life was upended in her early thirties by loss, crippling debt, and no easy path to income.

**It took me years of endless research, burning the candle at both ends, deprivation, experimentation, and false starts to finally crack the money code.**

**Today, I‚Äôm financially free and I know how to help you get here in a tiny fraction of the time it took me.**

There is a world of abundance just waiting for you. I can show you the path to that world.

Hop into the course and let‚Äôs get you there as quickly as possible.

I can‚Äôt wait to meet you and cheer you on inside of the *Foundation to Financial Freedom* course!

All my best,

Doris
