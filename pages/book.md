## A Must-Read to Help You Protect Your Finances

The first six chapters read like a gripping novel that you can’t put down.

That’s how one reader describes Doris’s story, as told in Part I of Protect Your Purse.

After sharing the details of how she went from being a successful academic to a widow with no real income and more than $400,000 of debt, Doris Belland shares the hard lessons she learned along the way.

Supported by interviews of more than three dozen women, none of whom foresaw the difficult life events they encountered, Doris connects the common issue of women not being in true control of their financial health because they did not make key decisions nor plan for what if.

***Protect Your Purse* goes beyond a list of “to-dos” to highlight larger issues for women and provide insights around:**

- Getting your head in the right space as your first step to financial control
- How to approach money challenges both before and after unexpected change
- Money being a tool to learn, not an emotion to manage, and
- How money creates options, not security

**It’s time to rethink how secure you are and take control of your own financial future.**

Doris will show you how to move through your fears, make a proactive plan, and build the confidence to create your life on your terms, regardless of what comes your way, secure in the knowledge that you are not alone.

I’ve met many business women throughout my life and I can attest with confidence that Doris is, by far, the smartest and most practical woman I know about finance and investing. I am astounded by **the clarity she brings to complex issues around family and finance, and she offers practical and actionable advice you can bank on.** I will refer her book to all the women in my life.

**An absolute must-read for all women.** If you think this book does not apply to you, then you need to read this book! Doris is a gifted writer, sharing a hard-to-talk-about subject in an easy-to-read way. The stories are compelling and the advice practical. Invest in yourself. Read this book. Open your eyes. Protect your purse.

Doris’ personal story is **compelling and inspirational**. Her book provides valuable insights — particularly for women — but the lessons in it are really for everyone.

Your greatest point of vulnerability is what you don’t know.

Read the book, learn the key questions to ask, and the steps to take to protect yourself financially.

Your future self with thank you.
