## A Free Money Class for Self-Employed Women: Take Charge of Your Personal and Business Finances

## Learn How to Make the Best Use of Your Dollars and Have Enough Money for Retirement... ...And the Top 3 Mistakes to Avoid.

## Live Training via Zoom

In this 45-minute training, youâ€™ll learn a simple approach to **make better financial decisions** that will help you:

- **effectively set up** your personal and business finances;
- eliminate debt;
- **grow your savings;**
- and be on track for a secure retirement.

Youâ€™ll also have the chance to get **personalized guidance** and answers to your money questions during the **Q&A session** at the end.

## Hereâ€™s a quick test of your money management system.

### Could you map out the cash in and out of your business and personal finances, showing:

- where the money is coming from and exactly **how much** lands in your account every month;
- **where** itâ€™s landing (Personal account? Business account? Savings account?);
- where it goes when it leaves your checking account â€“ and in what proportion (i.e. how much youâ€™re **spending** in all the key areas of your finances);
- exactly how much you **owe**;
- how much servicing your debt is costing you;
- how much you have left over every month;
- what your needs are in the coming months;
- how much youâ€™re setting aside for the future (i.e. your **savings rate**);
- and **what your plan is** for the dollars left over on a monthly basis (i.e. the positive cash flow)?

#### If you donâ€™t have a plan in place for the use of your dollars, then one thing is certainâ€¦

#### â€¦ youâ€™re wasting money.

And youâ€™re probably wasting time, too, jumping from one pressing financial task to the next.

To be financially free, you need to know the answers to the questions above.

**Especially if youâ€™re self-employed, because the flow of cash in and out of your life depends on you.**

## Learn a powerful money management system

## This training is for you if youâ€™re self-employed or you have a side gig and:

- You track your finances, but you don't really do anything with that information because you don't know what to do.
- You hope you'll have enough money in retirement, but you're not sure - and that worries you.
- You think, "It's ridiculous that I don't know my finances at my age... I feel I should know this."
- You're concerned about how to pay off your business and personal debt, and save enough for retirement.
- You know you should have good systems to manage your business and personal finances, but you're frustrated that nobody has ever shown you how to do it.
- Your business is making money, but there isn't much left at the end of the month. You're frustrated that you're not making financial progress for all your hard work.
- Confidence around your finances is a big issue for you. As a self-employed woman, you should feel confident about money... but you don't.

#### This Free Money Class will help you address these challenges and equip you with practical steps to avoid some of the most common pitfalls self-employed women face.

## Who am I and why should you listen to me?

Hi, Iâ€™m Doris.

Iâ€™m a former academic and researcher. I was widowed in my early 30s and inherited $400,000 of debt, which I paid off in 2 years.

Iâ€™ve since built a **six-figure business** and multi-**seven-figure investment portfolio**.

Iâ€™ve developed a **proprietary money management system** based on core values, using an **evidence-based approach**, after seeing that traditional money management approaches donâ€™t work for a large proportion of women.

Sixteen years ago, I dedicated myself to growing womenâ€™s financial literacy and their wealth.

I have since worked with thousands of women across Canada and the United States as a Financial Repair Specialist and Money Coach.

**More than 50% of my clients and course students are self-employed.**

I have a deep understanding of the challenges â€“ and the opportunities â€“ that self-employed women faceâ€¦

â€¦ and what it takes to thrive. **Iâ€™ll show you where to start, what to do, and what to avoid.** I hope to see you in the class!
