## If You're Ready to Take Charge of Your Moneyand Create Better Options For Your Future,You're In the Right Place

## Welcome to the Foundation to Financial Freedom Program, a Program Designed by a Woman, for Women, to Help You Take Control of Your Finances,Strengthen Your Relationship with Money, and Grow Your Wealth...... Using a Proprietary System Based On Your Values.

## Eliminate Your Debt and Save More Money, Without Nickle-and-Diming Yourself in a Restrictive Budget

##### When you use a proven system based on your core values‚Ä¶

##### ‚Ä¶ and you develop an empowering money mindset, saving money and achieving financial independence become doable.

##### In fact, they become inevitable when you automate the saving process in your money system.

##### In 9 weeks, you can transform your finances with this evidence-based, step-by-step system that is fully customized to your needs, values, and goals.

##### Stop depriving yourself and focusing on cutbacks.

##### You can‚Äôt chop your way to financial freedom.

##### It‚Äôs time to take a different approach ‚Äì one that doesn‚Äôt leave you feeling overwhelmed, discouraged, and resentful.

## If you're here, I know this much about you: You want more from your money.

When you entered adulthood, you were told to get an education, get a good job, follow a budget and you‚Äôd be in great financial shape.

**What happened to the ‚Äúgreat financial shape‚Äù part?**

Your finances aren‚Äôt as *easy*, or as¬†*secure,* as you thought they would be by now.

Some days you think, ‚ÄúAt my age, I should be father ahead. Why am I not?‚Äù

#### It‚Äôs not for a lack of trying.

Maybe you did the whole budgeting thing to get a handle on your spending.

You signed up for an app, tracked expenses, created categories and imposed spending limits.

Three months in, the whole ‚Äúmicro-managing‚Äù and ‚Äúobsessing-over-nickels‚Äù approach caused you so much stress and shame when you couldn‚Äôt stick to your spending targets that you said, ‚Äú!@\*?#ü§¨‚Äù while deleting the app.

Or maybe you‚Äôre the kind of super organized person who started budgeting when you were fifteen after getting your first job.

You know where every dime goes and you can list your budget off the top of your head.

Despite all that controlling and being careful, you‚Äôre still *nowhere near* your financial goals.

You think, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôm doing the work. When do I get to enjoy the fruits of my sacrifices?‚Äù

## The harsh reality is this:

## Tracking your money is NOT the same as managing your money. And until you make the switch, you won't create the life you want.

## The problem isn't you

- You went to school for years. In that time, you learned:
- Calculus, grammar, the historical events behind D-Day, the parts of a cell, and the skills to do your work.
- **But you were never really taught how to make, manage and grow your money.**
**- Your parents didn't teach you about money either - for a million understandable reasons that typically revolve around fear, discomfort, and shame.
- For most people, money is still a taboo subject.
- Your parents would rather talk to you about sex than money - and we all know how *that* talk turned out.**

**

## You need a better approach for your finances

One that helps you **systematically achieve your financial goals**.

One that‚Äôs easily doable by someone juggling 14 balls (that would be you).

And **one that works** ***right now** ‚Äì* without making money management and saving money feel like a punishment!

You don‚Äôt want to wait another ten years ‚Äì or more ‚Äì to be able to *finally* let your shoulders relax and enjoy life,  
without having to think about money ALL the time.

#### This is your chance to do just that without the restrictive, one-size-fits-all approach of traditional money management methods.

Introducing

 ![](https://yourfinanciallaunchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/UPDATE-FTF-Logo-Feb-2024-for-sales-page-case-study.png)

**A comprehensive, step-by-step program to help you take charge of your finances, eliminate money mindset blocks, build your confidence, grow your savings account, and create great options for your future.**

## Before we get into all the course details,let's make sure you're a good fit. If you are...

- **A salaried professional** ...  
	who earns well but can't seem to save money consistently despite repeated attempts. You want that feeling of having a growing savings account, but you don't know how to make it happen.
- **A single mom** ...  
	who feels the weight of being the Plan A *and* the Plan B for the kids because there is no other backup. It's so hard to juggle everything on your own and right now, your finances are an additional stressor. You want to know how to create a safety net that will protect you while providing enough money to help your family enjoy some of the good things in life.
- **A solopreneur** ...  
	who is so busy trying to bring money in the door that you don't have time to figure out how to make all the moving parts of your finances work together. You want to know how to manage your money when you can't predict your month-to-month income. It's overwhelming.
- **Newly divorced** ...  
	and you're having to deal with your finances alone - ALL of it - for the first time. You desperately want to feel in control and confident, but right now you're overwhelmed and uncertain about what to do first.
- **Someone who has debt** ...  
	and you're worried about the future. You've tried pretty much everything to pay it off, but somehow the debt keeps coming back. You wonder if being debt-free is even possible for you.

Think of this as Drop-In Office Hours. Attend as many sessions (or as few) as you like.

If you aren‚Äôt available for a scheduled session but you have a question, I‚Äôve got you covered. All the sessions are recorded.

When a financial question pops up over the next year, you simply reach out to me during the group coaching sessions and say:

‚ÄúHey Doris, what‚Äôs the best way to handle this? What are my options and how do I choose?‚Äù

Or:

‚ÄúDoris, I‚Äôm stuck. I just can‚Äôt seem to get moving. Can you help me through this?‚Äù

We can move as quickly or as slowly as you need in this **Done *With* You** package.

I will hold your hand every step of the way for an entire year.

> While the course is so helpful in setting up a solid financial foundation- **Doris's coaching calls are next level**.  
>   
> Admittedly I was apprehensive about the expense, especially because I was joining the course with 15K of debt. How could I afford this added expense? But **I quickly realized it was totally worth it, and actually helped me progress much faster towards my financial goals.**  
> I leave every call with Doris thinking ‚ÄúWow! That was exactly what I needed. How does she draw out all this poignant advice, off the cuff". She is insightful, knowledgeable, and direct, but always kind and non-judgmental. **I‚Äôve paid for lots of services in my life- but have never encountered anything as valuable and life-changing as this.**

> Doris is an amazing coach! **Her ‚Äúno blame, no shame‚Äù philosophy helped put me at ease to face my finances.** I finally uncovered and released some key subconscious beliefs that had been holding me back for years. I now feel more confident about how to manage my money. I highly recommend her program.

## But the best part about the CoachingPackages is the community.

Just imagine what it would feel like to tackle your finances *within a community of support‚Ä¶*

‚Ä¶ a group of women who *get* you because they‚Äôre doing the same kind of work on *their* finances.

Women who will cheer you on, support you through the hard times, and provide a safe space for you to talk about any part of your finances you like without shame, blame, or judgment.

It‚Äôs powerful!

##### Our community of women will keep you coming back every two weeks for twelve months to share, laugh, learn, and encourage each other.

## Meet Your Guide

#### Hi, I‚Äôm Doris!

I‚Äôm a financial literacy educator and Women‚Äôs Money Coach. I‚Äôve helped thousands of women take control of their money and transform their lives in the process.

In my early thirties, I was widowed and left with $400,000 of debt, which I paid off in two years. I‚Äôve since built a multi-seven-figure net worth and a thriving business ‚Äì using my skills as a trained researcher and an evidence-based approach.

Here‚Äôs what I know to be true:

It doesn‚Äôt matter who you are, what you know, or what your current situation is. Financial freedom is possible with the right system, ongoing support, and a safe, no shame, no blame, no judgment environment in which to learn.

#### This is that safe space for you.

In this course, I created the system and the plan that I wish I‚Äôd had years ago when I stared down a mountain of debt.

At the time, it felt like I had few options for my future.

This course would have changed my life.

I created it so that *you* can achieve financial security, peace of mind, and freedom in a tiny fraction of the time it took me to figure it out and make it happen.

Life is short. Don‚Äôt waste another minute settling for less than you want. You can do this.

**Hop into the program and let‚Äôs get you to financial freedom as soon as possible!**

## Why women only?

**Because the reality is that the financial conversation changes when men are present.**

I know this from my experience running women-only courses and co-ed courses.

I also know this from my experience running a Women‚Äôs Money Group.

Women who were otherwise vocal and expressive in a women-only setting clammed up when men were in the room. It didn‚Äôt even take a male stranger to make them feel less comfortable speaking about money. The men in question were their partners, sons, nephews, and friends!

That‚Äôs why I design my courses with women in mind and I offer my **coaching packages for women only**.

#### In my coaching community, you‚Äôll get a safe space to talk about money

#### and my signature No Shame, No Blame, No Judgment approach.

## Share this program with your partner!

If you‚Äôre in a relationship or you live with your partner, one of the best things you can do is share the recorded lessons with them.

Read Eva‚Äôs story below to see how powerful it is when both partners work together to create a strong financial foundation.

That doesn‚Äôt mean that you delegate or abdicate responsibility for creating your financial system. The entire point of this course is to make you a **Money Management Goddess**!

*You‚Äôve* got to know this stuff and be in the driver‚Äôs seat of your finances.

Once you‚Äôve done that, it‚Äôs a powerful thing to share this with your partner.

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you combine your finances or you keep everything separate. My system will work beautifully regardless of how you structure your finances.

In the **Money For Two Bonus**, I show you exactly how to do this.

I *know* that my students get great results when they do the lessons and implement what they‚Äôve learned, but I get that you don‚Äôt know that yet.

I want you to feel confident about taking this step and to be fully satisfied with your purchase.

So if you‚Äôre on the fence, or if other trainings have left you disappointed‚Ä¶

Then **I want to give you the opportunity to dive into the material and experience the feeling of empowerment and excitement** that comes taking control of your money ‚Äì *risk-free*.

## Still wondering if you should do this? ü§î

## Ask yourself this question:

## If I don't do this - make my financial goals a priority and invest in myself - what will be different about my life this time next year?

‚ú® Will I be closer to my goals?

‚ú® Will I feel less stress and overwhelm?

‚ú® Will I have knocked off the debt that is weighing me (and my future) down?

‚ú® Will my savings account balance be significantly larger?

‚ú® Will I have a sufficient Emergency Fund in place?

‚ú® Will I feel good about my spending and have a plan in place to achieve my goals?

‚ú® Will I be in control of my money?

**If the answer to any of the questions above is ‚Äúno‚Äù, then click on the Enroll Now button and let‚Äôs go.**

You *do* have what it takes to be financially strong. I‚Äôm here to guide you every step of the way.

## That said, there are some people who are not a fit for this course.

## This course is not for you if:

‚ùå You want instant results. Creating a strong financial foundation takes time. There are no magical shortcuts. It doesn‚Äôt have to take a long time to get great results, but it won‚Äôt happen overnight.

‚ùå You‚Äôre not willing to do the work. The best system in the world won‚Äôt do a thing for you if you‚Äôre not prepared to roll up your sleeves and do the work.

‚ùå You‚Äôre looking for a ‚ÄúDone For You‚Äù program. That‚Äôs not what this is. The only way to ensure a strong financial future is to build your skills, grow your confidence, and create an effective system. No one else can do that for you.

‚ùå You‚Äôre not willing to set aside some time every week to learn and implement. You must be willing to make your finances a priority.

I will show you what to do and how to do it, and I‚Äôll also provide a community of support ‚Äì but you‚Äôve got to step into this with intent and commitment. If you do that, I‚Äôll help you rock your finances.

## It‚Äôs not too lateEva‚Äôs story

**That‚Äôs exactly what Eva worried about when she first started to work with me and learn the system I teach in *Foundation to Financial Freedom*.**

At that time, Eva was in her mid-forties and faced a difficult situation.

She had six figures of personal debt, which didn‚Äôt include the **household debt** that she and her husband had.

She and her husband RARELY talked about money. Money talk was so stressful that it was avoided. They stuck to their respective tasks without ever working as a team.

Then there was the fact that she was a chronic **underearner** who charged too little for her services and burned the candle at both ends to please demanding customers.

Her space was cluttered, her health was compromised, and her world felt tiny.

Then something interesting happened.

**She started to learn my system:**

- of creating a healthy money mindset and reframing the story she told herself.
- of clarifying her core values and creating meaningful goals around them.
- of making financial choices that build toward those goals rather than focus on a chop and slash approach.
- of creating a solid plan to deal with her debt and optimize her finances to make that happen as quickly as possible.
- of dreaming about the life she really wanted to live and taking one consistent step after the other toward that life.
- of measuring what matters and making changes when she veered off course.
- of expecting and asking for more ‚Äì and getting it.

## Today, Eva‚Äôs life is unrecognizable even to herself.

She **paid off all her debts** ‚Äì yes, all six figures of it ‚Äì even as a low income earner!

She more than **doubled her income**, then decided she no longer wanted to do that type of work. She‚Äôs pivoting in a direction that‚Äôs in line with her desires.

She has a **weekly Money Ritual** in place.

She has an **Emergency Fund** and **Planned Spending Accounts** in place.

She‚Äôs now doubling down on **growing her investments and her portfolio recently crossed over the 6-figure mark.**

She has **transformed her relationship with her husband** when it comes to their shared finances. They now work as a team with regular finance ‚Äúdates‚Äù to track, review, and discuss.

**The household debt is all gone**!

#### She recently shared that her net worth has increased by more than 88% in five years, thanks to the course and the coaching.

But the best part is this, in Eva‚Äôs words:

> "I never allowed myself to dream so big until this post-debt era."

She‚Äôs got big plans and she‚Äôs incredibly excited about the future.

I could tell you similar stories about 50-something and 60-something women.

Your age doesn‚Äôt matter. Your desires do.

Don‚Äôt wait another second. Start today.

It is *not* too late.

If you have questions and you want to talk it out before making a decision, I‚Äôm here for you. Set up a complimentary 20-minute Discovery Call using [this link to my calendar](https://calendly.com/event_types/user/me).

## You deserve to have a life you love, without financial stress and overwhelm.

You also deserve a simple money management system that serves you, and not the other way around.

It doesn‚Äôt have to be hard and painful.

I say this as someone whose life was upended in her early thirties by loss, crippling debt, and no easy path to income.

**It took me years of endless research, burning the candle at both ends, deprivation, experimentation, and false starts to finally crack the money code.**

**Today, I‚Äôm financially free and I know how to help you get here in a tiny fraction of the time it took me.**

There is a world of abundance just waiting for you. I can show you the path to that world. It‚Äôs not too late.

Hop into the course and let‚Äôs get you there as quickly as possible.

I can‚Äôt wait to meet you and cheer you on inside of the *Foundation to Financial Freedom* course!

All my best,

Doris
