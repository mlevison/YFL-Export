What follows is the long, legalese version of our terms and conditions. If you enjoy long, legal descriptions, then grab a cup of coffee, put your feet up, and drill down into the nitty-gritty.

If you’re like us, though, you prefer a cut-to-the-chase summary. Here’s the quick scoop on using our site:

- **Everything on the YFL site is provided for informational purposes only.** We sincerely hope that the information helps you grow your financial literacy and build your confidence, but we do not in any way guarantee that it will.
- **The information provided on this website, in our workshops, on our blog, and in our courses should not be construed as personal financial advice. We accept no liability for the way in which you use the information provided.**
- **You and you alone are responsible for your results**. You must do your own research and make your own decisions before taking action with your finances. We will not be held responsible for any of your outcomes.
- **Everything you read or hear on our website, blog, groups, workshops, courses, or speaking engagements is our intellectual property**. Please don’t copy, share, or duplicate any part of it without our permission and appropriate attribution. It will make us grumpy and cause us to reach out to our lawyer for remedial measures. We don’t want that and neither do you.
- We do not endorse any member of our money group, speaker, investment, sponsor, advertisement or anything else presented during meetings, events, on the Women’s Money Group forum or on the website.
- We take your privacy seriously. Your information will never be sold or shared with third parties; it will only be used to provide the services you purchase or to send you YFL-related emails. That’s it.
- We use Google Analytics to track information that will allow us to make informed choices about how best to serve our clients. There is no identifying information in the data.
- Our site uses Cookies to help enhance your experience on our site. By using our site, you accept the use of these Cookies. If you wish to block the use of cookies, you may do so in your browser.
- We aspire to being fully compliant with all data protection regulations.
- We love interacting with you. Please reach out to us at info@yourfinanciallaunchpad.com if you have any questions or concerns.

If you are dissatisfied with the services, the site, the content, or these terms, your sole and exclusive remedy is a refund of the amount paid to YFL for services and/or content

## Errors and Inaccuracies

The information on the Site may contain typographical errors or other errors or inaccuracies, and may not be complete or current.

We do not, however, guarantee that any such errors, inaccuracies, or omissions will be corrected.

## Entire Agreement

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us relating to our Services, the Site, and the Content, replacing any prior or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, unless you have signed a separate written agreement with us relating to our Services, the Site, or the Content. If there is any conflict between these Terms and a separate signed written agreement between you and us relating to our Services, the Site, or the Content, the signed written agreement will control.

## Waiver

The failure by us to enforce any provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver. If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide the matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, then the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be removed from these Terms or reformed by the court and given effect so as to best accomplish the essential purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision, and all of the other provisions of these Terms shall continue to be valid and enforceable. Nothing contained in these Terms shall limit the ability of a party to seek an injunction or other equitable relief without posting any bond.

## Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue

These terms and our relationship with you shall be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario. You irrevocably agree that the exclusive venue for any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to these terms or our relationship with you regardless of theory, shall be the Provincial Courts located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. You irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of these courts and waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction by these courts and to this venue.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, you agree that we may commence and maintain an action or proceeding seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.

## Modification of Terms

We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time. Any changes that we make will become a part of our agreement with you when they are posted to the Site.
