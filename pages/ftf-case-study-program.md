## Welcome to the Foundation to Financial Freedom - Case Study Program for Self-Employed Women

## An Exclusive Program to Help You Take Control of Your Personal and Business Finances, Create Effective Systems, and Put Yourself On Track For a Secure Retirement - Without Penny-pinching and Overwhelm

## Imagine what it would feel like if your personal finances were running smoothly with a simple system that helped you become debt-free, save more money, and create better options for your future. Now imagine that your personal and business finances were optimized to work well together.

#### ‚ú® You‚Äôd have less stress; more peace of mind.

#### ‚úÖ You‚Äôd know exactly where you‚Äôre at financially, and what you need to do next.

#### üòä You‚Äôd have more time to breathe.

#### üéØ More time to focus on the things that matter most.

#### üí∞ And more money freed up to build wealth for your future.

#### Without uncertainty and guesswork.

#### The Foundation to Financial Freedom ‚Äì Case Study Program is designed to help you do just that.

## When you run your own business, it can feel like a juggling act.

You‚Äôve got a million responsibilities pulling you in multiple directions at once.

**You don‚Äôt just have your personal finances to manage and figure out; you‚Äôve got to do the same thing for your business, too.**

All the expenses, the debt, the cash flow issues‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ ensuring there‚Äôs enough **money in the accounts** at the right time to pay for it all‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ trying to **plan for your financial needs** in the coming months‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ while trying to **deliver great service** to your customers and find new customers to keep the company going.

It can be **overwhelming**.

You went into business because you had a passion, a desire, or skills that you wanted to share with others.

You had a dream of creating financial security.

**But the harsh truth is that your finances aren‚Äôt as *easy*, or as¬†*secure,* as you thought they would be by now.**

Some days you think, ‚ÄúAt my age, I should be father ahead. Why am I not?‚Äù

#### It‚Äôs not for a lack of trying.

Maybe you did the whole budgeting thing to get a handle on your personal spending.

You downloaded a budgeting app, tracked expenses, created categories and imposed spending limits.

Three months in, the whole ‚Äúmicro-managing‚Äù and ‚Äúcounting every penny‚Äù approach caused you so much stress and shame when you couldn‚Äôt stick to your spending targets that you said, ‚Äú!@\*?#ü§¨‚Äù while deleting the app.

And that‚Äôs just the personal side.

#### The business added a whole other layer of complexity to budgeting and tracking.

Or maybe you were so busy getting your business off the ground that you put off dealing with your finances.

You told yourself you‚Äôd get everything organized and separated when you had a bit of breathing space‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ But that breathing space never came, and now you have no idea where the line is between your personal and business finances.

Trying to figure it out is complicated because you have **no idea where to start**.

## The frustrating reality is this:

## There is no "right" time when getting your personal and business finances in order will be easier. And until you make the time, you won't create the life you want.

## The problem isn't you.

- You went to school for years. In that time, you learned:
- Calculus, grammar, the historical events behind D-Day, the parts of a cell, and the skills to do your work.
- But you were never really taught how to make, manage and grow your money.
- You probably weren't taught how to set up your business finances, either.
- Your parents didn't teach you about money for a million understandable reasons that typically revolve around a lack of knowledge, fear, discomfort, and shame.
- For most people, money is still a taboo subject.
- Your parents would rather talk to you about sex than money - and we all know how *that* talk turned out.

## You need a more effective approach for your personal and business finances.

One that works for self-employed women who don‚Äôt have a steady monthly salary.

One that‚Äôs doable by someone juggling 14 balls (that would be you).

And one that works *right now ‚Äì* without making money management feel complicated and restrictive.

You don‚Äôt want to wait another ten years ‚Äì or more ‚Äì to be able to *finally* let your shoulders relax and enjoy life, without having to think about money ALL the time.

#### This is your chance to put a simple, proven system in place and get the coaching you need.

## The education you wish you‚Äôd had about how to manage your finances?

## This is it.

## Before we get into all the program details,let's make sure you're a good fit. If you are...

- **A solopreneur** ...  
	who is so busy trying to bring money in the door that you don't have time to figure out how to make all the moving parts of your finances work together. You want to know how to manage your money when you can't predict your month-to-month income.
- **A small business owner** ...  
	and you're working at full capacity managing your small team while keeping the business running. You don't just *want* your finances to be easier; you *need* them to be simpler because time is a scarce resource. You want a plan, a path, and someone to show you what to do first.
- **A contractor** ...  
	with no job security. You never know if your contract will be renewed. You know you should have a Financial Plan B in place just in case, but you don't know how to make that happen. You want to know how to make saving money easier to build a safety net, because right now, saving money seems hard to do.
- **A Type "A" person** ...  
	who is generally well organized, but somehow your finances aren't where you want them to be and you're not sure how to fix that. You're tired of the disorganization and how bad it makes you feel. You want a simple system you can implement quickly and maintain easily, so that you can feel like you're on top of your finances.
- **Someone dealing with increasing debt** ...  
	and you're not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. You often "rob Peter to pay Paul", mixing personal and business money to try to make ends meet. You're exhausted and frustrated. You want to put a stop to the stress, get rid of the debt, and start feeling excited about the future again.
- **Someone with strong revenues** ...  
	but somehow the money disappears just as quickly as it came in. Your challenge isn't making money, it's *keeping* money. You want a system that will help you understand why the money disappears and how to fix it once and for all so you can start building wealth.

## You're in the right place!

### Why learn from me?

## Meet Your Guide

#### Hi, I‚Äôm Doris!

I‚Äôm a former academic turned financial literacy educator who has helped thousands of women take control of their money and create financial security.

In my early thirties, I was widowed and left with $400,000 of debt, which I paid off in two years. I‚Äôve since built a **six-figure business** and a **7-figure investment portfolio**.

I‚Äôve spent the last twenty years studying and testing how to optimize your finances, using my skills as a trained researcher and an evidence-based approach.

Here‚Äôs what I know to be true:

It doesn‚Äôt matter who you are, what you know, or what your current situation is. Financial freedom is possible with the right system, ongoing support, and a safe, **no shame, no blame, no judgment environment** in which to learn.

#### This is that safe space for you.

## Why learn from me?

- I use an **evidence-based approach** for *everything*. If it's not backed by research, I don't teach it.
- I've built a thriving business and a **multi-seven-figure portfolio** of investments, both in the stock market and in real estate. I know how to make, manage, and grow money.
- I've developed my own money management methodology based on more than **a decade of testing**. I know what works and what doesn't. More importantly, I know why.
- Teaching is my **passion**. I spent the first three years of university working toward a Bacherlor's Degree in Education, followed by a year teaching in France thanks to a scholarship. Even after my doctoral work in another field, I continued teaching and coaching in one form or another.
- I've coached hundreds of women directly and helped them to become debt-free, save thousands of dollars, and create rock-solid finances. Today, they're confident, financially secure, and excited about the future.
- I've been a business owner for **20 years**. I know the pressures and challenges that women in business face. I've helped countless solopreneurs clean up their finances and create simple, effective systems that allowed them to grow.
- I spent 10 years working as a **Financial Repair Specialist**. I know how to help women solve complicated, tricky financial situations.

## Why offer a women-only program?

**Because the reality is that the financial conversation changes when men are present.**

I know this from my experience running women-only courses, co-ed courses, and a Women‚Äôs Money Group.

Women, who were otherwise vocal and expressive in a women-only setting, clammed up when men were in the room.

That‚Äôs why I design my courses with women in mind and I offer the **coaching for women only**.

#### In my coaching community, you have a safe space to talk about money,

#### with my No Shame, No Blame, No Judgment approach.

I want you to feel confident about taking this step and to be fully satisfied with your purchase.

## The FTF Program - Case Study Edition isn't for everyone.

## This course is not a fit for you if:

‚ùå You want instant results. Creating a strong financial foundation takes time. There are no magical shortcuts. It doesn‚Äôt have to take a long time to get great results, but it won‚Äôt happen overnight.

‚ùå You‚Äôre not willing to do the work. The best system in the world won‚Äôt do a thing for you if you‚Äôre not prepared to roll up your sleeves and do the work.

‚ùå You‚Äôre looking for a ‚ÄúDone For You‚Äù program. That‚Äôs not what this is. This is a ‚ÄúDone With You‚Äù Program. The only way to ensure a strong financial future is to build your skills, grow your confidence, and create effective systems. I‚Äôll show you how, but no one else can do the work for you.

‚ùå You‚Äôre not willing to set aside some time every week to learn and implement. You must be willing to make your finances a priority.

I will show you what to do and how to do it, and I‚Äôll also provide a community of support ‚Äì but you‚Äôve got to step into this with intent and commitment. If you do that, I‚Äôll help you rock your finances.

I just completed the FTF Program. During my time with Doris, I‚Äôve moved my RRSP; committed to monthly contributions, and have watched my nest egg grow.  
I have implemented a regular financial review and **eliminated my corrosive debt.**  
  
**I see new opportunities for growing both my personal and corporate savings thanks to our coaching calls.**  
The biggest learning has been Doris‚Äô mantra - no shame, no blame, no judgement. When I slip into old spending patterns or beliefs, I remember that mantra and continue to move forward. Working with Doris has helped me focus on the life I want to have and to move toward it.

Kathrine L.

Contractor

Before taking Doris's program and coaching, I had a super complicated structure of business and personal financial stuff going on. It was overwhelming and I couldn't see what to focus on or what I even wanted.  
  
As a result of receiving her coaching, she helped me get clear on what I-I-I-I-I wanted and what my values were in priority order . **Within weeks and months, I started to make some major business and life decisions, to simplify and to prioritize what I really wanted.**  
  
It's amazing to look back and see how far I've come since then, **I couldn't have gotten that clarity without Doris!**

Thanks to the program and the coaching, I **paid off six figures of debt way ahead of projected schedule**. That's what's possible when you get clear and make decisions aligned with your values - the approach taught by Doris.  
  
Thanks to paying off the debt, my spouse and I invested over six figures of new cash into long-term investments.  
  
On the client side, I make more money on projects because I only work with aligned clients. **Overall, this means I now work less IN my business. I have more time for myself, and to work ON my businesses.**

After learning Doris's values-based approach in the FTF Program and getting coaching, **I have a clear picture of my finances and my habits. I also have tools and a debt payment plan** to put it all straight and start investing once again.  
  
I am in a much better place and am feeling good about where I am. **What a difference from a year ago when I felt I was drowning. I am not stressed about money now.**  
  
Doris helped me to see that one of my businesses was losing money and pulling me down. With her guidance, I was able to see what needed to be done to solve that situation and simplify my business life.  
  
**I now earn more than six figures, have caught up on all business taxes owing, and am close to paying off all my debt!**

### It‚Äôs possible for you, too.

### And now you have a Program tailor-made for you, a self-employed woman.

## You deserve to have a life you love without financial stress and overwhelm.

You also deserve a money management system that serves you, and not the other way around.

It doesn‚Äôt have to be hard and painful.

I say this as someone whose life was upended in her early thirties by loss, crippling debt, and no easy path to income.

It took me years of endless research, burning the candle at both ends, deprivation, experimentation, and false starts to finally crack the money code.

**Today, I‚Äôm financially free and I know how to help you achieve that in a fraction of the time it took me.**

There is a world of abundance just waiting for you. I can show you the path to that world.

Hop into the program and let‚Äôs get you there as quickly as possible.

I can‚Äôt wait to meet you and cheer you on inside of the *Foundation to Financial Freedom Program ‚Äì Case Study Edition for Self-Employed Women*!

All my best,

Doris
