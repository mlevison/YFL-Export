No **Shame**.  
No **Blame**.  
No **Judgement**.

No **Shame**. No **Blame**. No **Judgement**.

**Doris’ No Shame, No Blame, No Judgement approach immediately puts her audiences at ease – even with a potentially difficult subject like finances.**

This safe-space approach underpins all her work.

In addition, Doris uses her background as a researcher to incorporate psychology, behavioral economics, finance, and mindset research into every presentation.

Discussions about money are never *just* about money.

As Doris says, to get results you have to consider the whole person – their goals, fears, biases, and past experiences.

**Her success as a financial literacy educator and her popularity as a presenter are due to her comprehensive, unique approach to money management, an engaging, easy-to-understand delivery, and effective story-telling.**

Talking about money shouldn’t be boring or intimidating!

## From Corporate to Keynotes

Doris has shared her message at a wide range of events including workplace workshops, Lunch & Learns, conferences, and corporate events.

She is comfortable with audiences of all sizes and can deliver an engaging presentation both in person and online.

As the founder and host of the Women’s Financial Freedom Group (formerly the Women’s Money Group), Doris has been presenting online on a monthly basis since 2019.

Doris presented five workshops for our staff. The presentations surpassed our expectations. She received glowing reviews! Doris has great energy and knows how to introduce a topic that can be uncomfortable and stressful for so many. She makes people feel at ease. I particularly enjoyed the practical exercises – having participants identify their top values to begin shifting their mindset. I like that Doris linked financial stress to overall health, which is in line with our message to staff.

## While the location of Doris’ presentations varies, her core message never does:

- Your financial health is integral to your overall health
- A values-based approach is more effective and easier to maintain than a traditional budgeting approach
- To achieve financial freedom, you need to master the 2 Money Tracks: Mindset & Methodology (Make, Manage, Multiply)
- Money problems are never just about money
- Knowing how to invest using a research-based approach is no longer a nice-to-know skill for women; it’s essential
- Managing your finances is fun when you learn how to use money in a way that serves your highest, best interests
- Every financial problem has a solution
- Perfection is the killer of dreams. Progress beat perfection any day of the week
- It’s OK to delegate, but it’s never OK to abdicate financial decision-making
