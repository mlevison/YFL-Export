## Welcome to the Women's Financial Freedom Group!​

### A safe, judgement-free community for YFL Alumni where you can take your finances and your life to the next level.

**Become financially independent** and **build a life you love** with coaching, accountability, and support.  

## Hey there, welcome back!

## If you’re on this page, it’s because you’ve taken one of my courses or you’ve had some private coaching.

## What do you do now?

You’re on your way to building a **rock-solid financial system** that supports your most important **goals**.

Maybe you’ve taken my *Money & Mindset Cure* course and you’ve got your sights set on becoming **debt-free** and having a **double-digit savings rate**.

{Serious high-five my friend! 🙌}

Maybe you’ve taken my *Investing Made Simple* course and you’re *finally* growing **your very own portfolio**.

{Cue the mariachi band! 🎉}

Or you’ve just finished my comprehensive Financial Freedom Accelerator Program and you’re **cranking up your income**.

{You go, girl! **💰** }

#### But you still have soooooo many questions, right?

Just because you’ve finished a course or a coaching engagement doesn’t mean you’re done. There is still a way to go before you achieve financial freedom and create a life you love.

**It can be a lonely, frustrating endeavour to try to keep figuring it out and doing the work yourself.**

And by now, you’ve probably also discovered that **knowing what to do is only part of the equation**;

*doing* *it and **continuing to do it is where the magic lies**.*

#### That, my friend, is where the Women’s Financial Freedom Group comes in.

#### As a YFL Alumni, you are invited to join our By Invitation Only Group!

**The Women’s Financial Freedom Group is a place where you can:**

- - level up the financial **skills** you’ve developed
	- build and maintain key **habits**
	- connect with **like-minded** women – your financial BFFs
	- ask **questions** without being judged
	- get **coaching**
	- grow your **confidence**
	- keep improving your systems
	- make continual **progress**

Every month we connect live online to discuss what’s up in the world of personal finance, check in on your progress, work on your systems, address challenges, support each other, have fun, and hold each other accountable while making progress toward our individual goals.

One step at a time.

**It is a group of women committed to taking action and levelling up.**

It doesn’t matter how old you are or where you’re at financially.

What matters is that you want more from your money and your life, and you’re willing to do the work to keep moving forward toward your most important goals.

I've made more progress in the four months that I've been a member than in the seven years before that!

**If this resonates with you, then this is your invitation to join our** **Women’s Financial Freedom Group!**

Why plug away alone when you can turbo charge your results with our support, guidance, and encouragement?

Surround yourself with like-minded women who think it’s normal to talk about money and who want more from life.

**We know that the people we spend time with influence our results. This is your chance to curate your circle of influence.**

In this group, you get access to monthly online meetings designed to help you deepen your financial literacy, exchange ideas, and make money work for you.

When you get stuck, we’re here to help you figure it out and get through it.

That means less frustration, wasted time, and lost money.

If you’re not available the night of the meeting, you can view the recording afterward.

**In the Women’s Financial Freedom Group, you work on your finances *for* yourself, but not *by* yourself.**

Since joining the group, I have put away $8000 into my Retirement Savings Plan. Considering I had no savings when I started, and that I always felt money was too tight for us to save much, that’s a pretty big deal for me. This group is THE best investment I’ve made in the last 2 years.

The WFFG has given me the confidence to finally start figuring out what to do with my money. I’m no longer feeling overwhelmed and insecure.

Engaging as much as possible with the group has personally been a huge game-changer for me. It's been integral to my ongoing learning, progress, growth, and change. I have tripled my income, paid off more than $10,000 of corrosive debt, and increased my financial literacy exponentially.

## GET UNSTUCK

## KEEP PROGRESSING

## LEVEL UP

### Move past difficulties and roadblocks with our guidance.

### Avoid getting stalled through accountability, inspiration, and support.

### Achieve more by surrounding yourself with like-minded women.

The WFFG helped me build the knowledge, skills, and confidence to grow my money. With Doris’ guidance, and with the feedback from the other members, I learned about my own values (and fears) around money, which I had never articulated before.  
  
This has been a life-changing experience and it is helping me to put in place important and necessary systems to secure my financial future. This has brought me incredible peace of mind and for that I am forever grateful.

Invest in Yourself

If you’re like other women, you’re doing a great job of taking care of your family, your girlfriends, your community, your work, and the family pet.

When you show up on the list of priorities, you’re at the very bottom.

It’s time to change that.

**You deserve more than that.**

**It’s time to invest in yourself, in your possibilities, and in your future.**

You’ve already taken the first steps by taking one of my courses or getting some coaching, but what’s next for you?

**Think about this:**

**What if you don’t do anything more?**

Where will you be in five or ten years?

Will you have achieved the goals that matter most to you?

Will you be as financially solid as you need and want to be?

What opportunities will you miss out on if you don’t take the time right now to keep working toward your financial and life goals?

**You can try to figure it all out by yourself or you can speed up your results by joining our community of action-takers who are working their way to financial freedom.**

Surround yourself with a tribe of like-minded women who get you.

Today is the *perfect day* to do that.

Join our group and we’ll \*see\* you on the inside.

We’ll help you to keep making progress toward those awesome goals of yours.

One thing that has changed for me since I joined the group is that I LOVE managing my finances now. Really, truly enjoy it.

Doris makes money make sense. I could listen to her all day!

Every Monthly Group session seems essential! Thank you for offering such an important resource to me and other women.

#### FAQ

1\. Why was the Women’s Financial Freedom Group created?

The idea for a membership group was inspired by Doris’ 2017 research project in which she interviewed Canadian women from coast to coast to coast. Doris’ goal was to determine what women feel they need to learn when it comes to their personal finances, then create a course to address these needs. However, the list of topics requested was too large to cover in a single course.

Investing came up repeatedly as an area in which women feel intimidated. It was also clear that there were significant gaps in core financial literacy. Doris developed her money management courseand the *Investing Made Simple* course to address these areas of need.

The monthly membership group, on the other hand, allows women to continue their financial independence journey in a supported environment, and to connect with like-minded women in a safe, judgement-free space.

The group provides an opportunity to consistently apply your skills and knowledge. This is what builds helpful habits and, ultimately, helps you achieve better results.

The membership format also offers ongoing support and accountability as members work through every aspect of their finances. It helps to keep them on track and level up their results.

One of the biggest benefits to emerge from the Women’s Financial Freedom Group is the development of new friendships. One member describes the group as her “allies” in her quest to strengthen her finances. The result is a dynamic, diverse group of women willing to help each other, exchange of ideas, and provide encouragement.

2\. What’s the difference between monthly and annual memberships?

The monthly membership was developed for women who may need some financial flexibility. This membership level can be cancelled at any time. Please note that there are no pro-rated refunds for partial months. The monthly fee is automatically billed every month until you cancel.

The annual membership offers a reduced monthly rate. The membership is automatically renewed annually until you cancel and is not refundable given the additional benefit of a lower monthly fee.

3\. When are the monthly meetings?

The meetings take place the last Tuesday of most months, from 7 pm to 9 pm Eastern Time.

The are a few exceptions. In December, we hold the meeting a bit earlier in the month to work around holiday schedules.

4\. How can I access the meetings?

The meetings take place live via Zoom to allow you to participate regardless of where you live. Geography and the weather are not impediments!

We send a link via email prior to the meeting. The links are also posted on the Member Calendar on the Member Resources page.

5\. What if I’m busy the night of the meeting? Will it be recorded for later viewing?

The meetings are recorded and made available to all members a few days after the meeting.

NOTE: We work hard to ensure the safety of our space and our community. For this reason, recordings are for the sole use of members. **Sharing the meeting videos with non-members, in part or in whole, is prohibited**. Members who do not abide by this policy will have their memberships cancelled, without a refund.

6\. Which topics will be covered in the meetings?

The meeting topics vary every month.

We cover the latest developments that affect your finances. There is also an accountability segment to help ensure that you continue to make progress.

Some months, we analyze a book that Doris recommends. Other months, we have guest speakers who have unique expertise and experiences to share.  
  
There is also a Coaching Segment at each meeting to help members move past challenges and get their questions answered.

What People Are Saying About the Women’s Money Group

It’s great to see women of all age groups and professions gather to discuss the topic of money. The atmosphere is very relaxed, and this shows by the group’s participation and enthusiasm. What I like most is the host, Doris! I love her style, which is no pressure. We are not required to introduce ourselves, we are not put on the spot to provide our comments or input, and that brought my comfort level and interest right up. I am looking forward to learning more on how to take control of my money and my life!

I learn a lot every time I participate in the group. There's always more to learn... even when you or others might think you know it already!

Having the support and a community of energized women who want to get financially educated and talk freely about finances is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING and so needed! It is really helpful because the good energy is uplifting when it gets tough trying to tackle goals alone. It is also really grounding. There aren't too many ladies in my immediate circle of friends who want to talk about finances and investing freely and without shame, blame or judgement. The WFFG community and support is AMAZING!!! It helps so much!

We look forward to welcoming you in the Women’s Financial Freedom Group!
