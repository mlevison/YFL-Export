#### Let’s get you moving past challenges toward your most important goals.

If your finances are frustrating you right now, or you’re not sure where to start to take them to the next level, that’s OK.

It’s OK to be frustrated or stuck; you just don’t want to *stay* stuck.

- The good news is that it’s not too late to become financially strong:
- You *can* create the life you want
- You *can* feel confident, secure and in control of your money
- You *can* have the income, freedom and lifestyle you want without burning the candle at both ends

School didn’t teach you how to use money in your highest, best interests…

But I will – using a No Shame, No Blame, No Judgement approach.

## With my guidance, you’ll develop the financial skills and the systems needed to put you in the driver’s seat of your life

## The result?

#### Confidence and empowerment so you choose what’s in your highest, best interest

#### Financial independence that gives you more options so you can live your best life

#### Peace of mind so you can – at long last – let go of all that stress and overwhelm

## Hi there!

I’m Doris, and my mission in life is to help women become financially strong and confident…

… so you have the option to do more of the things you love without constantly second-guessing yourself and feeling overwhelmed.

I’ve spent two decades researching the most effective ways to manage money and build wealth. The result is a proven, evidence-based system that will work for you regardless of your background.

I grew my skills the hard way – you can read my story of ending up $400,000 in debt and paying it off in two years [here](https://yourfinanciallaunchpad.com/about/) – but you don’t have to.

Just follow my simple, tested financial system, which is **tied to your values and harnesses the power of a healthy money mindset**, to build the life you want.

If your relationship with money isn’t healthy, that’s OK. I know what it takes to move past fear, shame, financial ruts, and major mindset blocks to get to a great place.

I’ve helped thousands of women.

I can help you, too.

**One of the things that has changed for me is that I LOVE managing my finances now.** Really, truly enjoy it.

I cannot find words that adequately express how much working with Doris has meant to me. **I’ve made so much long-term progress, including paying off five figures of corrosive debt, more than tripling my income, and addressing many limiting beliefs.**  
  
My husband recently said that he's noticed that I'm really different when I talk about money these days. Not stressed anymore, and \*way\* more confident + optimistic.

**I feel a sense of freedom simply by now knowing where I stand financially and living within my means.**  
  
Financial freedom seems very possible and liberating. And this comes from the education and practice that follows from Doris’ steps of learning, reflection, learning, and action!
