## Hey there, I‚Äôm Doris

 ![](https://yourfinanciallaunchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/9170330.jpg)

One of my clients, **Diane**, called me her ‚Äúeffing Financial Fairy Godmother.‚Äù üòä

I don‚Äôt have a wand, but I *do* help women transform their lives by getting really good at managing their money.

Another one of my clients, **Willy**, sent me this message:

> I always appreciate your straightforward way of presenting the material. You are kind and compassionate, but I mostly appreciate your directness in telling us how it is.

I believe that the fastest way for a woman to become financially healthy is by taking an honest look at her situation, with a **No Shame, No Blame, No Judgment approach**‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ then taking one small step at a time to accomplish her goals.

What I offer women is an evidence-based approach on what works and what doesn‚Äôt when it comes to taking control of their money, building their confidence, and creating great options for themselves so they can lead life on their terms.

In my own story of transformation, I‚Äôve built two seven-figure portfolios and a successful business.

## Here‚Äôs the thing:

I **don‚Äôt** have an MBA. **Or** an Economics degree. **Or** a formal finance background.

*(But I‚Äôve had clients who‚Äôve had those degrees.)*

I‚Äôm a former doctoral candidate with a prestigious scholarship, whose life was upended when I found myself widowed in my early thirties.

And on top of that, I inherited $400,000 of debt, most of which was from my late husband‚Äôs business.

The problem ‚Äì beyond the obvious ‚Äì was that I had walked away from my studies to help him in his business.

I know ‚Äì what was I thinking, right?

### The thing is, it seemed like the right thing to do at the time. (I was soooo wrong.)

## My husband had cancer.

The cancer required invasive treatments.

He couldn‚Äôt work.

So I stepped in to run his business and take care of him.

**In the process, I walked away from security and a known path to success, into total vulnerability.**

And that is how life gave me a boot to the head.

![](https://yourfinanciallaunchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Book-image-1-300x200.jpg)I wrote a book about my experience ‚Äì and that of more than three dozen other divorced and widowed women.

It‚Äôs called Protect Your Purse, Shared Lessons for Women: Avoid Financial Messes, Stop Emotional Bankruptcies, and Take Charge of Your Money. [You can learn about my book here.](https://yourfinanciallaunchpad.com/book/)

Today, I am financially free, and I have helped thousands of women get fantastic results with their finances.

**Getting to this point, though, wasn‚Äôt easy.**

I wish I could say that I turned things around on a dime, but that‚Äôs not at all what happened.

When you don‚Äôt have guidance and support, it feels at moments as though you‚Äôve signed up for the Black Diamond path through life ‚Äì bumpy, steep as hell, and full of obstacles.

(I love to ski black diamond runs; I just don‚Äôt want that to be a metaphor for my life.)

When the fog of grief lifted long enough for me to realize the depth of my money problems, the researcher in me was determined to figure it out.

**Two years later, I was debt-free.**

## That‚Äôs when I started asking big questions

***How do women become financially vulnerable?***

***How can we build strong financial foundations to weather life‚Äôs storms?***

***Did others face massive mindset challenges when trying to move past other people‚Äôs expectations?***

(I was supposed to be a professor, not someone obsessed with women‚Äôs financial wellbeing, which prompted a ‚ÄúWTH?‚Äù reaction from a lot family and friends.)  
  

### So many questions and all of them complex.

  
As I tackled them, I started rebuilding my life through real estate investing.

I became the President of a real estate investors organization in my city as I built a seven-figure portfolio.

People who knew my turnaround story started asking me to help them solve money and credit challenges so that they, too, could buy real estate.

Before I knew it, I was spending as much time helping my clients sort out their financial challenges as I was building a real estate portfolio.  
  

### I had figured out what works and what doesn‚Äôt.

  
The entire time, I read everything I could get my hands on about managing money, investing, psychology, behavioral economics, and mindset.

After ten years of helping clients repair complicated financial problems, I realized I was seeing a clear pattern:

Women were almost always more financially vulnerable than men.

That was a defining moment for me.

I decided to dedicate my work to helping women build strong financial foundations.

## Today, through Your Financial Launchpad, I offer what I wish had existed for me all those years ago when I got serious about taking charge of my money:

- Evidence-based courses taught in plain English ‚Äì not blahblahblah spouted off by some dude trying to impress you with impenetrable jargon. (What the hell is with that?)
- An approach based on your core values and not traditional budgeting. Budgeting sounds so sensible, like it should work; but it doesn‚Äôt for a staggering number of people. Now I know why.
- A safe, judgment-free space to ask questions and talk about all those hard experiences, because heaven knows money comes with a hefty dose of shame and embarrassment ‚Äì which we all experience to some degree.

## I‚Äôve learned the hard way (remember that Black Diamond run?) over nearly two decades

Now I offer a **simple system** with guidance, so that you don‚Äôt have to face that steep, treacherous learning curve.

If you‚Äôve had enough of feeling that you‚Äôre not where you‚Äôre supposed to be financially, or you want dealing with money to be, well‚Ä¶ easier, I can help you with that.

Life without financial stress is as great as it sounds. The grass looks pretty green over here!

And the good news is that it‚Äôs within your reach.

You can absolutely learn to use money as a powerful tool to free you up to focus on the things that matter most for you.

Aside from helping women to rock their finances, I want to emulate a mountain goat and hike in the world‚Äôs most beautiful places. (OK, maybe I won‚Äôt perch on any ledges, though.)

You? What‚Äôs your dream?

Let‚Äôs make it happen.

It starts with understanding the order in which to tackle your finances.

Book a complimentary [Discovery Call](https://calendly.com/yfl/discoverycall) and let‚Äôs have a chat about the best place for you to start your own financial transformation.

Whatever your financial goals are, they‚Äôre *doable.* I‚Äôll show you how to accomplish them.
