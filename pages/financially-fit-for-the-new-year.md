### This training is for you if â€¦

1. Every January you set financial goals, and every December you realize youâ€™ve fallen short.

Iâ€™ll show you how to stop the cycle of saving a bit, spending more, feeling bad, promising to do better, and repeating the process with little financial progress.

2\. You know what to do to stop overspending, but you canâ€™t seem to stick to your plan.

The problem isnâ€™t you; itâ€™s the methods youâ€™re using. The most common approaches donâ€™t work for everyone and they certainly donâ€™t work over the long run. With a few simple but powerful shifts in strategy, youâ€™ll make wise spending choices and save money like a boss â€“ even through the holiday season â€“ without having to grow your income.

3. Cutting back on spending and budgeting feels like a punishment. Itâ€™s painful and you resent it.

Saving money and strengthening your finances shouldnâ€™t feel like a punishment. Iâ€™ll show you an approach that will feel empowering. Youâ€™ll be *excited* to match your spending to your goals.

I don't have a problem with overspending, but I do have trouble growing my savings. Will the training be helpful for me?

Yes. Learning how to make the best use of your money isnâ€™t only about making savvy choices with your spending, itâ€™s about learning how to grow your savings, too. Some of the strategies that work to eliminate overspending can be directly applied to growing your savings.

Youâ€™ll learn the key to my proprietary money management system that will make all the difference to your savings account.

What happens if I can't make it live?

I understand that life can get in the way of your plans, which is why I will be recording the training and making it available for a limited time â€“ 48 hours â€“ afterward.

After more than fifteen years of coaching people, I know that getting personalized guidance is invaluable.

Is this training really free?

Yes, itâ€™s free! I want to help you transform your finances and get a strong start to 2024 . You canâ€™t do that if youâ€™re overspending and your savings arenâ€™t growing. This is your chance to do something different in the new year.
