## If you‚Äôre here, I know this much about you:

#### You want so much more from your life.

When you entered adulthood, you were told to get an education, get a good job, follow a budget and you‚Äôd be in great financial shape.

**What happened to the ‚Äúgreat financial shape‚Äù part?**

Your finances aren‚Äôt as *easy*, or as¬†*secure,* as you thought they would be by now.

Some days you think, ‚ÄúAt my age, I should be father ahead. Why am I not?‚Äù

#### It‚Äôs not for a lack of trying.

Maybe you did the whole budgeting thing to get a handle on your spending.

You downloaded Mint, tracked expenses, created categories and imposed spending limits.

Three months in, the whole ‚Äúmicro-managing‚Äù and ‚Äúobsessing-over-nickels‚Äù approach caused you so much stress and shame when you couldn‚Äôt stick to your spending targets that you said, ‚Äú!@\*?#ü§¨‚Äù while deleting the app.

Or maybe you‚Äôre the kind of super organized person who started budgeting when you were fifteen after getting your first job.

You know where every dime goes and you can list your budget off the top of your head.

Despite all that controlling and being careful, you‚Äôre still *nowhere near* your financial goals.

You think, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôm doing the work. When do I get to enjoy the fruits of my sacrifices?‚Äù

### The frustrating reality is this:

*Tracking* your money is NOT the same as¬†*managing* your money.

And until you make the switch, you won‚Äôt create  
the life you want.

## THE PROBLEM ISN‚ÄôT YOU.

You went to school for years.

In that time, you learned calculus, grammar, the historical events behind D-Day, the parts of a cell, and the skills to do your work.

But you were never really taught how to make, manage and grow your money.

Your parents didn‚Äôt teach you about money either ‚Äì for a million understandable reasons that typically revolve around fear, discomfort, and shame.

For most people, money is still a taboo subject.

Your parents would rather talk to you about sex than money ‚Äì and we all know how *that* talk turned out.

## You need a better approach for your finances.

One that serves your unique situation, values and dreams.

One that‚Äôs doable by someone juggling 14 balls (that would be you).

And one that works *right now!*

You don‚Äôt want to wait another ten years ‚Äì or more ‚Äì to be able to *finally* let your shoulders relax and enjoy life,  
without having to think about money ALL the time.

#### This is your chance to do just that without the restrictive, one-size-fits-all approach of traditional budgeting.

## INTRODUCING:

 ![](https://yourfinanciallaunchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/YFTFF-Course-Logo-1024x367.png)

**A comprehensive, step-by-step course to help you take charge of your finances, strengthen your relationship with money, build your confidence, grow your savings account, and create great options for your future.**

Before we get into all the course details, let‚Äôs make sure you‚Äôre a good fit.

### If you are:

- **A salaried professional** ...  
	who earns well but can't seem to save money consistently despite repeated attempts. You want that feeling of having a growing savings account, but you don't know how to make it happen.
- **A single mom** ...  
	who feels the weight of being the Plan A *and* the Plan B for the kids because there is no other backup. It's so hard to juggle everything on your own and right now, your finances are an additional stressor. You want to know how to create a safety net that will protect you while providing enough money to help your family enjoy some of the good things in life.
- **A solopreneur** ...  
	who is so busy trying to bring money in the door that you don't have time to figure out how to make all the moving parts of your finances work together. You want to know how to manage your money when you can't predict your month-to-month income. It's overwhelming.
- **Newly divorced** ...  
	and you're having to deal with your finances alone - ALL of it - for the first time. You desperately want to feel in control and confident, but right now you're overwhelmed and uncertain about what to do first.
- **Someone who has debt** ...  
	and you're worried about the future. You've tried to pay it off, but somehow it just always pops back up again. You wonder if being debt-free is even possible for you.

## Student Success Stories

### This could be you ‚Ä¶

Recently finished the course and it exceeded my expectations! I've been telling everyone about it. **The focus on core values was such an important exercise and journey for me not only in my financial life, but across all categories!**  
I mapped out the next 10 years on what I call my "Freedom Timeline". **It feels so empowering** to have sight on the dark, dusty corners of my finances and to have hope that the future can look different. This motivates me as I pursue a new career helping others unlock what's keeping them 'stuck'. Excited to go after this beautiful life by design, not life by default!

Stephanie K.

I did coaching with Doris as part of the course. The coaching felt very personal and practical - it goes far beyond any generic advice or models. Doris is very good at what she does!  
Before the course, I don't think I realized what it takes to establish good patterns, regularly monitor money, set meaningful goals, and engage in regular reflection. I didn't expect it to be personal or emotional.  
**Doris's emails, modules and coaching have so much value and they make a meaningful impact by making visible things that have been invisible and deeply ingrained, unconsciously shaping our finances for years.**

Elizabeth C.

**What I learned blew me away and I am so grateful I did the course.**  
I would recommend it to anyone because it has left me feeling empowered. **It changed the way I look at spending  
and how I make decisions about my money and my time.**  
Conscious spending and value-based decision-making are powerful tools!

Jean N.

**This course is rocking my world!** The mindset piece was necessary to tackle the last frontier of the 'real estate between my ears'. I am consciously stepping away from the relationship I used to have with money. I think the course is essential and ground-breaking.  
Working on my values was incredibly useful and empowering. **Now I spend conscientiously, purposefully and without fear.**

Meet Your Guide

#### Hi, I‚Äôm Doris!

I‚Äôm a financial literacy educator who has helped thousands of women take control of their money and create great options for themselves.

In my early thirties, I was widowed and left with $400,000 of debt, which I paid off in two years. I‚Äôve since built a multi-seven-figure net worth and a thriving business ‚Äì using my skills as a trained researcher and an evidence-based approach.

Here‚Äôs what I know to be true:

It doesn‚Äôt matter who you are, what you know, or what your current situation is. Financial freedom is possible with the right system, ongoing support, and a safe, no shame, no blame, no judgment environment in which to learn.

#### This is that safe space for you.

In this course, I created the system and the plan that I wish I‚Äôd had years ago when I stared down a mountain of debt.

At the time, it felt like I had few options for my future.

This course would have changed my life.

I created it so that *you* can achieve financial security, peace of mind, and freedom in a tiny fraction of the time it took me to figure it out and make it happen.

Life is short. Don‚Äôt waste another minute settling for less than you want. You can do this.

Hop into the course and let‚Äôs get you to financial freedom as soon as possible!
