## If you‚Äôre here, I know this much about you:

#### You want so much more from your life.

When you entered adulthood, you were told to get an education, get a good job, follow a budget and you‚Äôd be in great financial shape.

**What happened to the ‚Äúgreat financial shape‚Äù part?**

Your finances aren‚Äôt as *easy*, or as¬†*secure,* as you thought they would be by now.

Some days you think, ‚ÄúAt my age, I should be father ahead. Why am I not?‚Äù

#### It‚Äôs not for a lack of trying.

Maybe you did the whole budgeting thing to get a handle on your spending.

You downloaded Mint, tracked expenses, created categories and imposed spending limits.

Three months in, the whole ‚Äúmicro-managing‚Äù and ‚Äúobsessing-over-nickels‚Äù approach caused you so much stress and shame when you couldn‚Äôt stick to your spending targets that you said, ‚Äú!@\*?#ü§¨‚Äù while deleting the app.

Or maybe you‚Äôre the kind of super organized person who started budgeting when you were fifteen after getting your first job.

You know where every dime goes and you can list your budget off the top of your head.

Despite all that controlling and being careful, you‚Äôre still *nowhere near* your financial goals.

You think, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôm doing the work. When do I get to enjoy the fruits of my sacrifices?‚Äù

### The frustrating reality is this:

*Tracking* your money is NOT the same as¬†*managing* your money.

And until you make the switch, you won‚Äôt create  
the life you want.

## THE PROBLEM ISN‚ÄôT YOU.

You went to school for years.

In that time, you learned calculus, grammar, the historical events behind D-Day, the parts of a cell, and the skills to do your work.

#### But you were never really taught how to make, manage and grow your money.

Your parents didn‚Äôt teach you about money either ‚Äì for a million understandable reasons that typically revolve around fear, discomfort, and shame.

For most people, money is still a taboo subject.

Your parents would rather talk to you about sex than money ‚Äì and we all know how *that* talk turned out.

## You need a better approach for your finances.

One that serves your unique situation, values and dreams.

One that‚Äôs doable by someone juggling 14 balls (that would be you).

And one that works *right now!*

You don‚Äôt want to wait another ten years ‚Äì or more ‚Äì to be able to *finally* let your shoulders relax and enjoy life,  
without having to think about money ALL the time.

#### This is your chance to do just that without the restrictive, one-size-fits-all approach of traditional budgeting.

## INTRODUCING:

 ![](attachments/YFTFF-Course-Logo-1024x367-1.png)

**A comprehensive, step-by-step course to help you take charge of your finances, strengthen your relationship with money, build your confidence, grow your savings account, and create great options for your future.**

You‚Äôll learn how to eliminate debt, build a financial safety net, and make more money so you can experience the peace of mind and the joy that come from knowing your future is secure.

Before we get into all the course details, let‚Äôs make sure you‚Äôre a good fit.

### If you are:

- **A salaried professional** ...  
	who earns well but can't seem to save money consistently despite repeated attempts. You want that feeling of having a growing savings account, but you don't know how to make it happen.
- **A single mom** ...  
	who feels the weight of being the Plan A *and* the Plan B for the kids because there is no other backup. It's so hard to juggle everything on your own and right now, your finances are an additional stressor. You want to know how to create a safety net that will protect you while providing enough money to help your family enjoy some of the good things in life.
- **A solopreneur** ...  
	who is so busy trying to bring money in the door that you don't have time to figure out how to make all the moving parts of your finances work together. You want to know how to manage your money when you can't predict your month-to-month income. It's overwhelming.
- **Newly divorced** ...  
	and you're having to deal with your finances alone - ALL of it - for the first time. You desperately want to feel in control and confident, but right now you're overwhelmed and uncertain about what to do first.
- **Someone who has debt** ...  
	and you're worried about the future. You've tried to pay it off, but somehow it just always pops back up again. You wonder if being debt-free is even possible for you.

### You‚Äôre in the right place!

*Your Foundation to Financial Freedom* Course will give you the step-by-step plan, tools, inspiration and support you need to create a system where money serves your highest, best interests and leaves you **free to enjoy your life**.

## By the end of the course you will have:

### 1\. Put a stop to unhealthy money patterns and self-sabotage

and started writing your own Money Story based on what matters to you. Your mind will be your ally when it comes to achieving your financial goals.

### 2\. Implemented a proven money tracking system and created a weekly Money Ritual

so that you can keep an eye on the key numbers that lead to financial freedom. You'll know what you spend, where, and why.

### 3\. Created a financial decision-making framework

based on your core values and your life goals. You'll use your values as your North Star to make the best use of your money.

### 4\. Created a Conscious Spending Plan and Grown Your Savings

and you'll have all your essential accounts in place. Each part of your finances will be optimized through automation and regular review practices.

### 5\. Put together a sustainable debt elimination plan with a "Debt-Free Me" date

and you'll know what to pay off first, including how much to pay every month. You'll also have the right mix of credit cards for you.

### 6\. Learned strategies to grow your income

using money-saving scripts, negotiation strategies, and a blueprint to build a side gig if you choose.

If you are not where you want to be with respect to your finances, take this course! It changed so much for me.**  
I went from living in ignorance and fear about my financial situation to taking charge and feeling totally empowered and in control.**  
The benefits of the course also extend far beyond finances.

## Student Success Stories

### This could be you ‚Ä¶

Recently finished the course and it exceeded my expectations! I've been telling everyone about it. **The focus on core values was such an important exercise and journey for me not only in my financial life, but across all categories!**  
I mapped out the next 10 years on what I call my "Freedom Timeline". **It feels so empowering** to have sight on the dark, dusty corners of my finances and to have hope that the future can look different. This motivates me as I pursue a new career helping others unlock what's keeping them 'stuck'. Excited to go after this beautiful life by design, not life by default!

Stephanie K.

I did coaching with Doris as part of the course. The coaching felt very personal and practical - it goes far beyond any generic advice or models. Doris is very good at what she does!  
Before the course, I don't think I realized what it takes to establish good patterns, regularly monitor money, set meaningful goals, and engage in regular reflection. I didn't expect it to be personal or emotional.  
**Doris's emails, modules and coaching have so much value and they make a meaningful impact by making visible things that have been invisible and deeply ingrained, unconsciously shaping our finances for years.**

 ![](attachments/pexels-daniel-xavier-1239291-resized.jpg)

Elizabeth C.

I knew this financial journey would be transformative, but I didn't imagine this! I f\*\*\*ing love Doris!!! She is my financial fairy godmother! **Doris's money system and her coaching have been a huge part of turning my life around.**  
She is the exact kind of cheerleader that I need in my life to stay on track towards a new way of being. She also has the ability to challenge me to push myself in a motivating way. I'm thanking the universe for her again.

Diane S.

Doris is brilliant at synthesizing info and providing a list of doable action items that yield impactful results. **I've used what I've learned from Doris and her course** - her lessons on mindset and her values-based system - **to pay off five figures of corrosive debt, triple my income and increase my financial literacy exponentially.**

 ![](attachments/pexels-ketut-subiyanto-4473398-resized.jpg)

Eva S.

**What I learned blew me away and I am so grateful I did the course.**  
I would recommend it to anyone because it has left me feeling empowered. **It changed the way I look at spending  
and how I make decisions about my money and my time.**  
Conscious spending and value-based decision-making are powerful tools!

 ![](attachments/troy-wade-dYgyzxlHJ58-unsplash-resized.jpg)

Jean N.

**This course is rocking my world!** The mindset piece was necessary to tackle the last frontier of the 'real estate between my ears'. I am consciously stepping away from the relationship I used to have with money. I think the course is essential and ground-breaking.  
Working on my values was incredibly useful and empowering. **Now I spend conscientiously, purposefully and without fear.**

## Want the best results? Get a year of coaching, support, and guidance.

The coaching sessions take place every other Wednesday evening from 7:30 pm ‚Äì 9:00 pm Eastern. You can access the next coaching session as soon as you register.

Think of this as **Drop In Office Hours**. Attend as many sessions (or as few) as you like.

If you aren‚Äôt available for a scheduled session, but you have a question, I‚Äôve got you covered. All the sessions are recorded. You can still submit a question and listen in at your convenience after the session.

When a financial question pops up over the next year, you get to reach out to me during the group coaching sessions and say, ‚ÄúHey Doris, **what‚Äôs the best way to handle this**? What are my options and how do I choose?‚Äù

Or, ‚ÄúDoris, I‚Äôm stuck. I just can‚Äôt seem to get moving. Can you help me through this?‚Äù

This is also a great option if you want to take your finances to the next level.

We can move as quickly or as slowly as you need in this **Done *With* You** package.

Meet Your Guide

#### Hi, I‚Äôm Doris!

I‚Äôm a financial literacy educator who has helped thousands of women take control of their money and create great options for themselves.

In my early thirties, I was widowed and left with $400,000 of debt, which I paid off in two years. I‚Äôve since built a multi-seven-figure net worth and a thriving business ‚Äì using an evidence-based approach and my skills as a trained researcher.

Here‚Äôs what I know to be true:

It doesn‚Äôt matter who you are, what you know, or what your current situation is. **Financial freedom is possible with the right system, ongoing support, and a safe, no shame, no blame, no judgment environment in which to learn.**

#### This is that safe space for you.

In this course, I created the system and the plan that I wish I‚Äôd had years ago when I stared down a mountain of debt.

At the time, it felt like I had few options for my future.

This course would have changed my life.

I created it so that *you* can achieve financial security, peace of mind, and freedom in a tiny fraction of the time it took me to figure it out and make it happen.

**Life is short. Don‚Äôt waste another minute settling for less than you want. You can do this. I‚Äôll show you how.**

Hop into the course and let‚Äôs get you to financial freedom as soon as possible!

## You'll be backed by a 30-Day Money Back Guarantee

**If you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúThis sounds great, but I‚Äôm still not 100% sure‚Äù you can try the course risk-free with my 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee.**

I know what it‚Äôs like to be interested in taking a course, but you wonder, ‚ÄúWill this meet my expectations? What if I don‚Äôt like it?‚Äù

I *know* that my students get great results when they do the lessons and implement what they‚Äôve learned, but I get that you don‚Äôt know that yet.

I want you to feel confident about taking this step and to be fully satisfied with your purchase.

So if you‚Äôre on the fence, or if other trainings have left you disappointed‚Ä¶

Then **I want to give you the opportunity to dive into the material and experience the feeling of empowerment and excitement** that comes taking control of your money ‚Äì *risk-free*.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm offering a **30-Day** **Money Back Guarantee:**

If you‚Äôve watched the video lessons, completed the exercises, attended the group coaching sessions and you don‚Äôt find the course useful by the end of 30 days, send me an email and I will happily refund your full payment within 30 Days of your registration. No hard feelings!

I‚Äôm SO confident that if you implement what you learn inside *Your Foundation to Financial Freedom*, you‚Äôll transform your money and your life.

**You have nothing to lose and a bright, secure future to gain.**

## Burning Questions from Previous Course Students

**Question #1:** ‚ÄúI want to take your course and I'm considering the Premium package, but I‚Äôm not sure of my schedule over the next few months. What if I‚Äôm not available when a module is released or when there‚Äôs a coaching call?‚Äù

You will receive an email with the link when each module is released, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to start at that time or even on that day.

The **lessons are pre-recorded,** and you have **lifetime access** to the course, so you can start and proceed on your schedule.

With the Premium Package, you get access to one year of group coaching sessions.

All the **group coaching sessions** will be recorded.

If you have a question and you know you won‚Äôt be available for one of the calls, simply submit your question ahead of time and I‚Äôll address it during the coaching segment. You can watch the recording at a time that works for you.

**Question #2:** ‚ÄúWhat if I have a question as I‚Äôm going through the course? Do you offer coaching or support?‚Äù

There are three different course packages to choose from. If you would like access to coaching and and Q&A with Doris, choose either the Premium or the Platinum Package.

The Essential package is for self-guided learning. That said, you will have access to the **private Facebook group** where students can ask questions, support each other, and exchange ideas.

If you have a question about accessing the course or you‚Äôre having technical issues, you can reach out to us for help. The contact email for our support team is provided in the welcome email once you register.

**Question #3:** ‚ÄúWhat if the course isn‚Äôt a fit for me. Can I get a refund?‚Äù

Absolutely! I‚Äôm so confident in the value of the program that I offer a 30-Day **100% Money-Back Guarantee.** If you‚Äôre not happy, you‚Äôll get every penny back within 30 days of the course start date. No hassles or hard feelings!

**Question #4:** ‚ÄúDo I need math or tech skills to do this course? I'm not great at either. Will this affect my results with the course?"

Absolutely not. You don‚Äôt need any math or tech skills to get great results with this course. I wanted this course to work for everyone, which is why I show you exactly what to do and how to go about calculating the key number you‚Äôll need.

If doesn‚Äôt matter if you hated math class, nor does it matter if you don‚Äôt know the first thing about spreadsheets. There‚Äôs nothing fancy or complicated in the course. It‚Äôs a simple system that works for everyone. You‚Äôre good to go!

**Question #5:** "Do I get the full course all at once?"

The Modules are released on a weekly basis, with Module 1 becoming accessible the day you register. The following modules are released in the following weeks. There are two Implementation Weeks built into the program to give you time to do the fun work.

Remember that you also have lifetime access to the program. You don‚Äôt have to watch the modules on the day they become available!

**Question #6:** "I'm torn between the Essential Package and the Premium Package. Which would be better for me?

I‚Äôll be honest here. The Essential Package is for self-driven, committed DIYers.

There is a lot of data about online courses and it‚Äôs crystal clear: Unless a student has support, ongoing accountability and help when life gets challenging, odds are they won‚Äôt finish the course.

I also know from fifteen years of coaching that the people who get the best and fastest results are the ones I coach directly. Everyone benefits from coaching.

Here‚Äôs my suggestion: If you can do it, get the Premium Package that comes with twelve months of coaching. It will make a huge difference.

If you can‚Äôt swing it, then start where you can with the Essential Package and hop into the course Facebook Group to connect with your peers.

**Question #7:** "I notice that you only talk about women. I'm a guy and I'm interested in taking your course. Is that possible or is it just for women?"

It‚Äôs true that the course was designed by a woman for women. It‚Äôs also true that the coached options are for women only. However, the Essential Package, which is self-guided, is open to everyone with one caveat.

Men are welcome to purchase the Essential Package. That will give them access to the important information about how to create a values-based money management system. They just won‚Äôt have access to the Facebook Group. The latter is solely for women to preserve the safety of the space for all women.

I do offer private coaching for everyone. If you think you would benefit from coaching, reach out and ask to set up a Discovery Call to discuss what makes sense for you.

**Question #8:** "The payment plan for the Essential Package has 3 payments whereas the plan for the Premium Package has 12 payments. Why the difference?"

Both the Premium and Platinum Packages offer payment plans over 12 months because that‚Äôs the duration of the group coaching sessions for those levels.

The content for the Essential Package is delivered within three months. The number of payments reflects the time it takes to receive the complete content for the level in question.

## Still wondering if you should do this? ü§î

## Ask yourself this question:

**If I don‚Äôt do this ‚Äì make my financial goals a priority and invest in myself ‚Äì what will be different about my life this time next year?**

‚ú® Will I be closer to my goals?

‚ú® Will I feel less stress and overwhelm?

‚ú® Will I have knocked off the debt that is weighing me (and my future) down?

‚ú® Will my savings account balance be significantly larger?

‚ú® Will I have a sufficient Emergency Fund in place?

‚ú® Will I feel good about my spending and have a plan in place to achieve my goals?

‚ú® Will I be in control of my money?

**If the answer to any of the questions above is ‚Äúno‚Äù, then click on the Enroll Now button and let‚Äôs go.**

You *do* have what it takes to be financially strong. I‚Äôm here to guide you every step of the way.

## It's not too late

*

If you‚Äôre worried that it‚Äôs too late for you ‚Ä¶

- Too late to pay off your debt.
- Too late to save enough for retirement.
- Too late to leave a job you don‚Äôt like.
- Too late to reach financial freedom

I want to reassure you that it is definitely *NOT* too late.

I hear this concern from 30-somethings and 60-somethings alike. My answer is the same every time:

When you learn my **proven, values-based framework** ‚Äì with a strong emphasis on a healthy money mindset ‚Äì and you receive **the support you need** to handle the bumps in the road, **achieving financial freedom isn‚Äôt just possible for you, it‚Äôs doable *by you.***

*

*

## You deserve to have a life you love without financial stress and overwhelm.

You also deserve a money management system that serves you, and not the other way around.

It doesn‚Äôt have to be hard and painful.

I say this as someone whose life was upended in her early thirties by loss, crippling debt, and no easy path to income.

**It took me years of endless research, burning the candle at both ends, deprivation, experimentation, and false starts to finally crack the money code.**

**Today, I‚Äôm financially free and I know how to help you get here in a tiny fraction of the time it took me.**

There is a world of abundance just waiting for you. I can show you the path to that world.

Hop into the course and let‚Äôs get you there as quickly as possible.

I can‚Äôt wait to meet you and cheer you on inside *Your Foundation to Financial Freedom*!

I‚Äôll see you on the inside.

All my best,

Doris
