## When it comes to investing, a lot of women feel overwhelmed, intimidated, or just plain scared.

### If that describes you, you’re in good company.

### I used to feel that way about investing, too.

### It’s understandable:

- You’re afraid to make mistakes. **What if you lose money?** You worked so hard for it. The last thing you want to do is screw it up and have all those dollars disappear forever.
- It **seems super complicated.** What is it with all that jargon, anyway? Even talking to a financial advisor can leave you blinking doe-in-headlights style.
- Maybe you tried it in the past and it didn’t work out well. Could it be that you’re just not cut out to be a good investor?
- **It seems so risky.** Someone you know lost a lot of money on a “sure thing”. You definitely don’t want to gamble with your money.
- Your colleague is killing it in the markets (and constantly talking about how much money he’s making) but he spends hours analyzing companies and stock charts. The idea of doing that **gives you a headache**. Not even remotely interested.

### So what happens to women who are afraid to invest?

### They typically make choices that work against them in the end. 📉

### That’s what my guide is all about.

## Hi, I'm Doris!

Over more than a decade of working with women as a money coach and financial literacy educator, I’ve noticed that **women typically make three mistakes** when it comes to investing.

👉 And those mistakes **HARM their financial future.**

From my experience, the worst thing about this situation is that women don’t realize their actions will have negative consequences down the road.

By the time they become aware of the problem, they’ve lost thousands of dollars and critical time that could have been used to create wealth.

Now they have to work even harder. 😩

The thing about wealth for women is that **wealth = options**.

It’s about creating a life in which you have the power to choose. 💪

**That’s powerful.**

❌ I don’t want you to fall prey to simple, avoidable mistakes that will hurt your financial future.

The sooner you make the highest, best use of your money – and make it work harder *for* you, rather than the other way around – the sooner you can live life on YOUR terms! ✨

And the sooner you can achieve **peace of mind**, **confidence** in your money skills, and **excitement about the future**.

**Get started by downloading my FREE Guide to The Top 3 Investing Mistakes Women Typically Make and 5 Strategies to Address Them.**

Once you learn about the common mistakes, you won’t look at your finances the same way again. 🙌

**I promise!**
