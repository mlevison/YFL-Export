### If any of the following sound like you, do yourself a favor and do not miss this Money Class‚Ä¶

- You hope you'll have enough money in retirement, but you're not sure - and you wonder if it's too late. {It's not, but **time is an important factor** and the sooner you take charge of your investments, the easier it is to become financially secure.}
- Someone else invests your money for you and you don't fully understand what they're doing. {When you understand investing, you **make savvier choices** and your money grows more quickly as a result.}
- You're concerned about how to pay off your debt and save more money. {It would be SO freeing to have a system that helps you **save money automatically**.}
- You track your finances and you have an idea of where your money goes, but somehow there's never enough to invest, travel, and pay for all the things your love. {A good money system **makes it easier to fund your priorities**.}
- You know you should have an effective system to manage your finances, but nobody has ever shown you how to set it up and where to start. {When you get guidance and a simple, **easy-to-maintain system**, it changes everything.}
- You want so much more from your money, but something is holding you back. {When you identify **the missing link**, you set yourself free to accomplish *all* your financial goals.}

## What People Are Saying‚Ä¶

The power that I feel understanding even a little bit \[about investing\] is almost intoxicating!  
  
In the past, I went to my investment appointments and I really just pretended to understand. It made me feel dumb, insecure, and inadequate. BUT, thanks to what I learned from Doris, now **I'm getting it. I feel confident moving forward on my own**.

Jean N.

Mortgage broker

Thanks to Doris's teaching and coaching, I was able to understand my existing investments and realize they weren't serving me.  
  
I moved my investments, increased my TFSA and RRSP contributions to max out these accounts and upped my pension matching contribution plan at work. **I'm feeling way more competent, confident, and in control of our money - with a plan in place.**

Maria N

Marketing Professional

\[What I learned from Doris\] has given me confidence to pursue investments. My husband and I are **now moving forward with retirement confidently**.  
  
This year, when I make my next transfer into my discount brokerage account, my investments will tip over from being valued at 5 figures, to 6 figures. And by the end of the year, my net deposits will surpass 6 figures. This is a huge milestone for me..

Eva S.

Designer

Doris's values based approach in her Program is really on my mind as I stare at bank accounts that now have 6 figures in them.  
  
Such a change from a decade ago, when I sold my last business and faced the bank account with multiple 6 figures....but with very little idea on how to put them to work in my best and aligned interests.....and so they got spent....  
  
Not this time!! **Now I know what to do with my money**.

## A Note From Doris‚Ä¶

(your personal guide to taking charge of your money, building wealth, and setting yourself free to live your life on *your* terms ‚Äì without burning yourself out‚Ä¶)

**I wish I‚Äôd known what I know now back when I was a 30-something widow who‚Äôd left her fully funded Doctoral studies to help her sick husband, then was left with $400,000 of inherited debt after his death‚Ä¶**

Twenty years of research, 10 years of being a Financial Repair Specialist, 16 years of working as a Financial Coach, and 2 seven-figure investment portfolios have taught me A LOT about how to manage money, build wealth, and create a life of financial freedom that brings me joy.

My mission today is to teach you how to achieve financial freedom and peace of mind for yourself, too.

**There will never be a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù time to start, but there is a better time for sure ‚Äì and that‚Äôs as soon as possible.**

A lot of women of all ages worry that it‚Äôs too late for them. It‚Äôs not, but real talk here: you don‚Äôt have a moment to lose.

This brand-new Money Class is the culmination of the top things I‚Äôve learned in helping women become financially strong over the last sixteen years ‚Äì including myself. I‚Äôm genuinely excited to teach you these hard-won insights.

This is your chance to put the financial literacy pieces and skills in place to transform your life today and your retirement.

The best part is that I take a research-based approach to everything I teach‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ which means there are opinions and generalizations based on just my own experience; there is a proven system that is duplicatable regardless of your current skills or your background.

If you‚Äôve dreamed of having enough money to do the things you love, or you long for financial peace of mind, then you, my friend, are in the right place.

**Choose the time that works best for you** and I‚Äôll see you there!
