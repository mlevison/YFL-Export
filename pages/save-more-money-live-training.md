### This Virtual Training Is for You If …

1. Every January, you set savings goals, and every December, you realize you’ve fallen short.

I’ll show you how to stop the cycle of saving a bit, spending more, feeling bad, promising to do better, and repeating the process with little growth in savings.

2\. You know what to do to stop overspending, but you can’t seem to stick to it.

The problem isn’t you; it’s the methods you’re using. The most common approaches don’t work for everyone and they certainly don’t work over the long run. With a few simple but powerful shifts in strategy, you’ll make wise spending choices and save money like a boss, without having to grow your income.

3. Cutting back on spending to free up dollars for your savings feels like a punishment. It’s painful and you resent it.

Growing your savings and, in turn, building a strong financial foundation, shouldn’t feel frustrating and awful. I’ll show you an approach that will feel empowering. You’ll be *excited* to match your spending to your goals.

### If any of the above sounds like you, do yourself a favor and grab a spot in this training.

## Your Burning Questions ~ and My Answers

Is this Virtual Training actually live?

Absolutely. I will be there to greet you at the start, then walk you through the training. In 45 minutes, I’ll share 3 common approaches to reducing spending that typically fail and 3 proven strategies to build up your savings account.

I don't have a problem with overspending, but I do have trouble growing my savings. Will the training be helpful for me?

Yes. Learning how to stop overspending is only half of the equation. The other half is learning how to grow your savings. Some of the strategies that work to eliminate overspending can be directly applied to growing your savings, too.

You’ll learn the key to my proprietary money management system that will make all the difference to your savings account.

What happens if I can't make it live?

I understand that life can get in the way of your plans, which is why I will be recording the training and making it available for a limited time – 48 hours – afterward.

If you can, though, you *definitely* want to attend live because I’m going to offer a bonus during the training – and it will only be available to those who attend live. You won’t want to miss out! Attending live is also the only way you can participate in the Q&A and coaching session at the end.

Will there be a chance to ask questions during the Virtual Training?

There certainly will. You’ll have a chance to get *all* your questions answered. At the end of the training, I’ll open up the lines for some Q&A. I want to ensure you fully understand the strategies I’m going to present so that you can make the very best use of them in your finances. After fifteen years of coaching people, I know that getting personalized guidance is invaluable.

Is this training really free?

Yes, it’s free! I want to help you transform your finances in 2023. You can’t do that if you’re overspending and your savings aren’t growing. I’m offering this training for free to get you off to a great start this year.
