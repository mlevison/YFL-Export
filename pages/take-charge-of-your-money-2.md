**Create a Values-Based Money System to Live Debt-Free, Grow Your Savings, and Develop Great Options for Your Life**

**Have you ever thought that you’d like more from your money, but you don’t know where to start or what to do? 🤔**

Are you experiencing financial overwhelm?

Do you wonder if you should focus on paying off debt or building your savings?

Have you tried budgeting, but it never quite worked for you?

Do certain aspects of personal finances make you feel “dumb and insecure”, as one of my clients put it?

**Are you worried that you’re behind financially? That it may be too late for you?**

If so, you’re not alone. Many women feel that way, too.

### There’s GOOD NEWS:

The ***Take Charge of Your Money*** Course is designed to help women like you create an effective money system and achieve financial security using my proven, step-by-step program and tools.

We focus on *your core values,* not generic budgeting categories.

It’s not a one-size-fits-all approach, because your values and your goals are unique to you.

Your financial system should reflect that and make it easier, not harder, to get the outcomes you want.

With my system, you have a simple and powerful framework from which to make all your financial decisions.

And the best part? It’s easy to maintain.

Judith Cane, Canada’s Money Coach

In the ***Take Charge of Your Money Course*** you will learn how to create an effective, easy-to-maintain system to manage your finances regardless of where you’re at today.

**You don’t need to know a thing about personal finance to take this course. I’ll teach you everything you need to know to succeed.**

The course will help you get in the driver’s seat of your finances, build your confidence, and get great value from your money.

We’ll start with your foundation – your values – and systematically work our way through each core element of financial literacy, which are the building blocks of a strong financial system.

The course content list is below.

> "Such a busy work summer! I don't remember going that long before without doing my account balances and tracking. **Happily, thanks to what I learned in the course, I had automated all my payments, so no missed payments!**  
>   
> I was very nervous about finally sitting down though, thinking I had likely overspent, increased debt, etc. I was wildly surprised to find I hadn’t overspent and was still on my original plan for paying down my credit cards. I looked over everything to see how this could happen and **I realized it was because I was living in line with my values.**  
>   
> I remember being almost shocked, because in years past if I had gone through a period of that craziness and then tried to reconcile, I would wince at the 'mess' I might have gotten myself into - I find I don't 'worry' about finances as I used to, because I know I will not overspend on anything that does not align with who I am now. It is a huge relief to me to know the bills are getting paid, savings is happening, and I'm still making a dent on my debt while NOT having to think about my finances every spare minute (as I would have done years ago as a single mom). Thank you!!"

## Why Get Coaching? 🚀

I’ve heard this from every one of my coaching clients: coaching gets your faster and deeper results.

Can you do this course on your own? Absolutely.

Would you benefit from guidance? 100%

Here is a partial list of the benefits of having me guide you through the material:

- You get **customized feedback** on your particular situation. Personal finances are not one-size-fits-all. Your situation may call for a unique approach.
- **I can address any mindset issues** that arise as you make your way through the material.
- I can **help you drill down on your core values to get clarity**, then help you rank them in order of priority. Identifying your core values sounds like easy, obvious work, but it’s not. It can be tricky to get at the root of what matters most to you and why. Since your values provide the framework for your financial system, this is an important component.
- Because of my extensive experience in working with people to strengthen their finances, **I see gaps, vulnerabilities, and opportunities that my clients don’t.**
- I know how to determine which parts of your system will provide the biggest wins, **saving you time and money**.
- You don’t just learn from me; **you learn from hearing other course participants’ questions** and hearing me coach them.
- The group acts as **a powerful accountability partner for you**, helping to keep you moving forward.

You know how you work best. If you feel that you would benefit from our group, then grab a spot right away as enrollment in the group coaching is limited to ensure that I can provide in-depth guidance for every participant.
